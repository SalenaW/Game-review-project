Sun585,One of the things I like the most abot the TLOU series: It triggers Gamer Gate trolls :) You know? White  Gen X dudes who have 'Leon' phantasies about Joel and Ellie.

asadrocky,"Left Behind absolutely justifies its existence because Ellie's backstory adds so much to her motivations during the base game. Ellie and Riley's relationship is so easy to get invested to from the beginning. The game switches back forth perfectly between a part in the base game and 3 weeks before she met Joel. Both timelines have natural parallels to each other as the past timeline slowly starts relating to the current timeline. Riley strenghtens Ellie's character immensely as she takes many traits and beliefs from Riley, and it also adds weight to many scenes from the base game. Although only 3 hours long, its narrative is strong and the $15 price tag is reasonable. By far, one of the best story DLCs ever created!",normal,2020-07-24,English,0,0,10

In this game you control Ellie and go through a short event from the first game that was not actually shown. While playing, you will go through a few flashback memories of Ellie that will reveal a bit more about her past and her time before the events of the first game.,The gameplay mechanic is completely the same as in The Last of Us: you will encounter infected and armed people that you will either fight or seek for a way to avoid them. The only difference is that you control Ellie, who is much smaller and weaker than Joel.,The game is short, it is just a small additional part to the main game.

I loved witnessing further character and world development as well as receiving background information on a crumbling society in the wake of a raging apocalypse. The reveal of Ellie and Riley’s young and innocent romance was awesome! It definitely inspired me into coming to terms and discovering my bisexuality later in life! Thinking back to when I played this game 5 years ago, I will always remember how inspired I felt seeing a resilient, tough, and witty young female character such as Ellie who usually in videogames tend to get underestimated.

Disko-Kjell,"This works as a great DLC and expands the lore of The Last of Us, while not disturbing or altering the main game's story. This DLC gives a deeper understanding of Ellie and why she behaves the way she does. Like in the main story, Ellie has a great chemistry with her partner, which in this game is Riley, and I truly believed that these were two best friends trying to make the best of the world they live in, much thanks to the actresses great work. Cutting between the naïve Ellie and the hardened Ellie during winter trying to keep an unconscious Joel alive. It's an interesting dynamic of character which shows what she has learned between the two time periods. A problem I have with Left Behind is the runtime of around two to three hours. Those two to three hours are great, but it feels like more content could have been given to these characters, but at least it never drags or outstays its welcome. The new welcoming mechanic of making the humans infected fight each other is refreshing and makes the player react to battles differently and it shakens things up. If you don't have had enough of The Last of Us, then this is a sure purchase on your front. Just be prepared that it isn't that long, clocking in at around three hours maximum if you search every level.",normal,2020-07-07,English,0,0,8

CapnConundrum,"The whole point of Ellie's character is her innocence and childlike quality, and all the emotional effect she adds to the main game is predicated upon that.  This dlc strips her of that.  It's just stupid, and it's terrible writing.  It's done to be trendy and that's extremely patronising to the people it's trying to emulate.  I was very disappointed that they went in that direction.  As for the rest of it, I love Ellie, and I love getting to play as her.  I did enjoy the whole thing.  I was expecting a much greater deviation from the story though.  I was thinking you might play as Joel's brother or something, and try to make a safe town.  That would have been something interesting and new within their world, and given Neil Druckman's narrative prowess, it would have felt like a good short story.  Instead, to follow the metaphor, it's like an unneccessary addition to an already perfect book.  It's like buying a chapter that was quite rightly edited out.  It's still great because it's The Last of Us, and I'll give it a high-ish score only because I want to be fair, but in the context of the story, just take it or leave it.  You wouldn't be missing much.  Weighed against The Last of Us, it sucks.  I'm honestly not sure whether it adds or detracts.",normal,2017-05-16,English,1,0,7
tremault,"This DLC was not something I looked forward to. I have seen many DLC that are so low quality and add very little substance to the original. then I saw this through to the end and I have to say this effected me far more than the entire game of 'last of us'. the story of the two young girls rekindling their friendship was so deep and it totally drew me in. It was so well staged that I fell in love with Riley and after finishing it I have found myself in tears a lot recalling the precious moments they spent together. It's so magical, it reminds me of a lot of precious moments from my own life and the delivery is incredible. there were times that I just didn't even think of them as characters, the animation and lighting etc was so realistic I felt like I was looking at real people.,The action parts and traversing the environment was fairly rewarding. I liked the change in the way the game plays with the different character. climbing and getting around the environment seems more of a focus with Ellie and the fighting also has me feeling more vulnerable. which is perfect for playing as a young girl. Fact is though, she can truly do some real damage and hold her own in a pinch which impresses me no end.",normal,2017-04-05,English,2,1,9

Well, Left Behind heads up delivering lackluster gameplay and the worst love story in video history. Not only is the revelation of Ellie being gay something that completely undermines this great character, but the banter between her and Riley (her actor does a horrible job) lack the substance that Ellie's interactions with Joel had in the main game. The encounters with both the hunters and infected in the winter chapter are the high points of the DLC, but the human AI isn't good enough to be intimidating. Not to mention the fact that Left Behind is two hours long and has little replay value. All this for $10 or $15! JUST DON'T BUY IT!

Thegodfatherson,"NOTE: I DID NOT PLAY THIS ON A PS3, I PLAYED THE PS4 VERSION.,,Left Behind, is an undoubted masterpiece, it is one of the best DLC's out there. There is much more to the heart wrenching story of The Last Of Us, Left Behind is more human and excel in every way. It starts up in th middle of the events of The Last Of Us, Joel is badly wounded, and Ellie needs something to patch him up, or he will die of blood loss. She ventures into the Shopping Mall to find Health Aid Kits. But the story jumps back and forth between Ellie's mission to help Joel and Ellie's past with her friend Riley. And the transition between these events takes place smoothly enough to give you a sense of excitement and sadness mixed together in a nice martini of passion made by developer Naughty Dog. The best moments strike when you go around the mall with Riley and explore things that Ellie has never seen before, like Photo Booths, Merry Go Rounds and Arcades. At one point, you get to have a water fight and go inside a Halloween shopping store and dress up as wearwolves, and at one point in your life, you may have down those things, that is why Left Behind is so excellent on its own way. It is so human, that even when you're having fun, you are crying inside of you, it's clings on to you and never lets go even after it ends. There are smartly designed combat sections, like always, the horror is there and it is better than ever. If you have played The Last Of Us, you might know that the clickers of runners are no the biggest threat, the humans are, and the AI has significantly improved over the main game itself. If you have finished one of the best games ever created, this should be a breeze for you, a breeze that is warm and smells nicer than ever. At one point, I found a tape recorder that had a recording of a soldier telling his story as his wounds drag him down and eventually kill him, the depth gone into each and every part of this game is incredible and a Naughty Dog continues to impress me game after game and DLC after DLC. Left Behind is a must play, you have to experiance this human masterpiece. Left Behind can be called a game of it's own, you'll cringe, you'll cry, you'll remember.",normal,2015-04-25,English,4,2,10

JAGUAR10,"I haven't even finished this yet but already I don't like it.  I absolutely LOVED The Last of US  - best game and story I've ever played - played it about 3 times already and counting.  Gave it a 10 out of 10.  This DLC has ruined it for me.  Ellie was cute and precocious in TLOU with her occasional cussing here and there - somehow they made it cute - probably because she had more profound dialog in other areas. In Left Behind they went overboard - she comes across as a foul-mouthed wanna-be punk trying to please Riley by showing her how cool she is and how much she can cuss.  Can't believe this came from the same writer.  Or did it?  At one point she says, 'they can suck my dick?""  She doesn't even have one!!  This line totally turned me off coming from Ellie.  Totally unnecessary.    I do not like the Riley character at all - she doesn't really seem to care for Ellie at all - she's a manipulator and seems like a thrill-seeker who doesn't care if Ellie gets in trouble.  And spending 1/2 hour in a Halloween shop listening to two teenagers cuss up a storm is my kind of fun!  NOT!!   The whole time they were in the mall I kept wanting to scream to them - ""You idiots - keep your voices down, there could be infected around!!""  Totally inane dialog and did not make me like either of them at all.  In fact, I felt sorry for Ellie.  She needs to 'wisen the **** up' regarding Riley.,,And then the gay thing - why do they always have to throw this crap in games?  I'm not anti-gay -  I'm anti-gratuitous sex!!  I just don't see the reason for this.  Why couldn't they just be friends without having sexual overtones thrown in?   I know some girls go through this getting a crush on an older girl stage in life, but what I'm against is gratuitous sex, period!  And I'm getting sick of it in games, TV, movies, etc.  This game would have been just fine (well, a lot better anyway) without that scene!!   Even though they implied that Bill was gay (there we go again) TLOU  had no sex or romance and was a 10 out of 10 game!  That should tell you something Naughty Dog.  You don't need sex to sell games.  Good stories and game play sell games.  And Bill was extremely funny and had great lines!  Best minor character, IMO.   And it seemed to fit with the world - not too many women around his town so it made sense.  A good story is what counts -  And Left Behind is not a good story.  In fact, it lowered my opinion of Ellie - I thought she was smarter that this!,,The only thing that saves this DLC is when Ellie is hunting for supplies to help Joel.  Then we get back to the real Last of Us.  I absolutely love the Joel character and this was one of the most touching scenes in the first game.  Always wondered how Ellie stitched him up or even got him back on the horse after he fell off.,,I'll continue playing but I was glad I used an Amazon gift certificate for this so was only out $4.99.  Not your best effort at all, Naughty Dog.  More is not always best - we don't need more sex, more cussing and more background to Ellie's life just to make a buck.  Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!,,BTW - this is the reason I do not pre-order games.  You think a company makes a great game so the next will be great?  NOT!!!  No matter how great the first game is companies tend to rush out DLC or 2nd games just to make money.  Was burned by Dragon Age 2, Watch Dogs, etc.  and now this.",normal,2014-08-25,English,12,6,1

With that said, the $15 I payed for this 2 hour sad fest was very disappointing, if anything this DLC should have been free to $5. Keep in mind when I say this I think most DLC should be around $5 if your only getting 1 or 2 hours of content that may or may have not been ripped from the making of the original game.  Anyway, this is not any special insight into Ellie’s background, there is one tiny revelation that is hinted at earlier in the game that is confirmed here. Nothing else, the DLC is filled with bad mini games, along with one specific battle that feel like it was pulled from the original game and shelled off as DLC. The only part I enjoyed was some of the dialogue. I just can't understand how people are OK with paying $15 for this.

GamergodsFail,"The Last of Us: Left Behind is what you'd expect from Naughty Dog. Intense, emotional, compelling, captivating, and well put together. This DLC clocks in at around 3 hours long, and not one minute of it drags behind. Naughty Dog put in great effort into making their very first single player DLC.,There are 2 different stories that play back-to-back here, and it fills in some of the gaps that seemed to have been unexplained in the main game. However, I thought the ending felt just a little rushed and inconclusive. It also felt a little too short for a $15 asking price. That's $5 per hour, if you don't plan on replaying it on a higher difficulty or finding all the collectibles. A 3-hour long DLC inside a 12-hour long main game is fine. It's the price that bothered me. I felt this should've been only $10. Also I did have a couple minor problems with the gameplay, such as the huge difficulty spike at the end, and Ellie automatically standing up after stealth killing an enemy from a crouched stance, causing you to make noise by accident.,Everything else about this DLC exceeded my expectations. It was an incredibly satisfying short addition to my favorite game of 2013. For the most part. Good job, Naughty Dog. You developers never disappoint.

The story of Left Behind is masterfully written, giving more insight to Ellie's relationship with Riley, as well as showing you the unforgiving world of post-apocalyptic USA, one more time. The combat introduces Infected and humans in the same area, with you right in the middle. You can use the Infected to get the humans or use stealth to sneak past all of them.

RhettDG,"A poorly written afterthought that was overly reliant on her relationship with her friend.  If you played Last of Us, there is nothing new.  When I say nothing new I mean nothing period.  The game is the same and you know EXACTLY what happens.  Nothing is added to the narrative and nothing is helpful in filling out the backstory.  This DLC was a waste of time, it was a waste of my time and money and it was a waste of Naughty Dogs time.  The only thing that people remotely talk about is that two girls kiss.  Its there to either shock you, make you feel good, or to push an agenda, nothing more.  This DLC ANGERED me and I am upset that I had to pay for it, regardless of the price.,The combat itself is all the same.  They force you to fight in a large and excessive enemy rush that seems tacked on and unnecessary.  Even the often referred to ability to coax survivors into fighting infected is badly programmed at best.  The enemies clearly seem unintended to fight one another so it becomes a joke to watch them flail around in a mock fight.,You'll love this DLC if you fall into the trap of whatever message they seem to think they are trying to share.

PCR,"Left Behind reminded me why I loved The Last of Us so much. It was easily my favorite game of 2013, and possibly my favorite game of all time. When the first and final single-player DLC, Left Behind, was announced, I couldn’t wait to jump back into the incredible world that Naughty Dog created.,,Left Behind takes place before the events of The Last of Us. You play as Ellie and are accompanied by your best friend, Riley. This takes place before Ellie ever met Joel. In addition to playing as a slightly younger Ellie in the events that took place before The Last of Us, the game also fills you in on what Ellie was up to while Joel was nearly bleeding to death during the campaign. At first, it may not make sense as to why the game shows these two events together, but it becomes more clear as the game progresses that there is a correlation, mostly emotional, between the two events.,,Playing as Ellie feels a lot different than playing as Joel, as one would imagine. Ellie can handle herself well, but she’s not as hardened of a killer as Joel is, obviously. Ellie dons her trusty switchblade, but don’t let that make you feel comfortable. I found that it’s better to be as stealthy as possible, especially when playing on Hard or Survivor difficulties.,,I absolutely love the relationship between Riley and Ellie that developed over just a couple hours. It made me think about my best friend growing up, and just how special a friendship between two teenage girls can be. It was nice to meet someone that Ellie cared about other than Joel, and it really made me realize why she is so scared to lose someone again. She needs Joel as much as he needs her.,,Final thoughts,,Gameplay: Like I said before, playing as Ellie feels much different than playing as Joel, and it’s definitely more difficult to play as Ellie. However, the combat is very refreshing, and it felt good to kill Infected again.,,Appearance: As expected, environments and all visuals are absolutely gorgeous. I really missed this world, as weird as that may sound. I know Ellie would kill for the opportunity to escape that world as soon as possible.,,Sound: The voice acting performed by Ashley Johnson and Yaani King is superb. Their friendship is absolutely beautiful, and this could not have been fully realized if not for the incredible acting performances. The music is borrowed from the main game’s soundtrack, and is beautiful, as always.,,Bottom line: Any fan of The Last of Us cannot afford to miss this brilliant story expansion. If you have not played the main campaign, please do not play this DLC; it will mean almost nothing to you. However, if you played and enjoyed the incredible universe that Naughty Dog created, do not miss out on Left Behind. At $14.99, it may seem a bit pricey for just over two hours of gameplay, but it’s worth every penny.",normal,2014-02-26,English,11,2,9
NK_1975,"Frankly speaking I don’t agree The Last of Us is a gaming’s Citizen Kane moment. More likely it’s kind of gaming world’s Stagecoach. John Ford’s movie was a revolution of already existing Western clichés & forms mixed in something apparently new. Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us did the same using zombie games stereotypes. And it was such an amazing experience.,,The Last of Us: Left Behind is a fundamentally different story. What is shocking it is not obvious but that is dull. Apparently there is a bravest descent from top art form to fashionable banality which I have ever seen. I got a friendly advice for Sony Computer Entertainment: please carefully produce Druckmann-Straley team in the future. I presume that the worldwide acclaim is much better choice instead of politically correct hype that has no sense of proportion and lacks of good taste.,,P.S.

insloanwetrust,"Left Behind is a fantastic prequel to The last of us. It focuses on Ellie and her friend Riley. It's about Ellie's back story before the events of The last of us. It also ties in with the main story but I won't spoil anything here. This game takes story telling, characters, emotion and relationship building to a whole new level. You will just have so much fun and play with a smile on your face living the life's of two teenage girls as they go about their life's in a post apocalyptic world. The game focuses more on their characters and relationship and it has a more relaxed and playful tone than the main game. There are also new combat editions that makes you able to pit Humans against the infected that was really cool to play around with. The mini games and side stuff where really fun, an arcade game you play really has you enthralled and a water gun fight is somehow intense. I believe the best parts of the game are when you're just doing everyday teenage girl things. Of course in a post apocalyptic world that's filled with infected it's not all fun and games and you will have to deal with them. Ellie is much different than Joel in this regard. She is more nimble and has a handy knife but is a lot weaker and feels more vulnerable. The gameplay is identical to the main game and that's good because it's perfect. This game is short however but it's absolutely quality over quantity with this one. This DLC will stick with you and give you some talking points after the credits have rolled.

The DLC has no real impact on the story as its mainly just a flashback and I found it to be unnecessary that Naughty Dog hinted that Ellie may be gay or bi-sexual.

I get that alot of games are doing it now, Mass Effect 3 is one of my all-time favorites and I greatly enjoyed the LGBT characters Steve Cortez and Samantha Traynor but for Naughty Dog to follow in the footsteps of so many others and suggest Ellie may be gay or bi-sexual in my opinion was just  an unnecessary side story to a otherwise awe-inspiring video game.",normal,2014-02-24,English,11,7,5

potatoes351,"The highly anticipated DLC to The Last of Us has arrived. Set before the main game, Left Behind shows us a glimpse into Ellie's past set between the American Dreams comic book and the beginning of the main game. The game also has sections that place themselves between the Autumn & Winter chapters where Ellie needs to care for Joel after the incident at the University.,The story is of course the main point and Left Behind is essential for any TLoU player, it brings a whole other context to some of the events in the main game and gives Ellie's final speech at the end of the main game even more of an impact than it did previously. I wont spoil anything, but as long as you have avoided spoilers so far, you'll be in for a hell of a surprise around 3/4ths of the way in the DLC.,The DLC is between 2 & 4 hours long and plays very similarly to the main game with the only exception being that the combat is a lot more difficult due to scarce supplies & playing as a weaker character.,In short, buy Left Behind if you have The Last of Us and if you dont have The Last of Us buy them both now. There is a reason why this was the best game of 2013 and the DLC only proves that point more by sending a powerful & shocking message to the games industry as a whole, an industry afraid to shift away from generic, brown haired male protagonists to now have an extremely beloved character to be the exact opposite of that.,Hats off to Naughty Dog for another stand out experience and here's hoping we get to have another experience with The Last of Us in the future.",normal,2014-02-23,English,15,3,9

The DLC shines some light on some of the events in the main game giving the ending and relationships formed within the single player campaign even more effect and potency . I will not talk about,story for long as it is best experienced blind but the basic plot is Reilly and Ellie two best friends exploring a run down mall in a post apocalyptic america before the events of the main game.

The environments are as detailed as before and there a few collectibles that aid in building up the story. The dialogue with Ellie and Riley is really well done. I think this DLC is meaningful and adds value to the TLOU story.,,If you are someone who played through the original game and didn't care about the story development, characters, or dialogue, you won't like this DLC. It's light on action and the focus is really on story development. The action is still good, just not really new.,,I think this DLC could have been a little longer and maybe had a little more action, but I recommend it to those who are big fans of all aspects of the original game. Those who value action over story may wish to skip this one, or may want to wait for a price reduction, if possible.,,I played this on Survivor difficulty and have all collectibles and conversations.

Xbox,"The three words I used to describe ""The Last of Us"" were:  uncompromising, beautiful, and tragic.,The three words I use to describe ""Left Behind"" are:  intimate, awkward, and evocative.  Although I am a middle aged parent, I was quickly beguiled by the portraits of Ellie and Riley and their relationship.  It reminded me of my own adolescence:  the frustrations and joys of trying to figure out people and the world.  Reluctantly clinging to but then shedding the familiarities of childhood while pretending to be ready and confident to deal with matters of imminent adulthood.  ""Left Behind"" painted this familiar, but often easy to mess up, narrative in the context of the grim realities of ""The Last of Us"" with such skill and nuance that a lot can be written and still not do it full justice.  My simple recommendation is, like the full game, to take your time and play the DLC to the maximum.  Consume every last drop and at the end you will be amazed, satisfied, and reflective.,,I am probably in the minority when I say that I hope that Naughty Dog does not make a sequel or more DLCs to ""The Last of Us"".

People who say this costs too much are just plain  dumb because most dlc has 1 hour of story content but is then filled to 5 hours with repetitive combat. Bioshock dlc anyone???

Kenmei,"Any excuse I get into playing more, original content for the Last of Us, I'll be all over. And this is no exception. There's alot to love about this short experience but there's a few things that don't really gel within the game. The game is goes from a series of flashbacks to present time, within the game, where you learn more about Ellie's motivations about why she's doing what she's doing. The introduction of the character of Riley, who we've only heard about till this point, was well done. The storyline about her and Ellie's final day together was, by itself, enough for admission for me. There's a particular stance that the writers took here with their relationship that I fully applaud, even though it feels a bit forced. I won't go into details about the biggest key moment in the DLC, but it's got alot of people talking about it right now, and for good reason. I do feel like the combat portions of the game probably didn't need to be there. I wish the DLC had just focused on Ellie and Riley instead of trying to force you through a part of the main story that wasn't really necessary. It was a great experience and just goes to remind you that this is the last bit of original content for the Last of Us, which is really sad. The game and story end on a high note, just like everything else involved with the game. This truly was one of, if not the, best game of the last generation and it goes out with a bang.

justachair,"This was maybe hte most anticipated DLC of the year, so Naughty Dog HAD to deliver, having the tough job of having to match the excellence of the full game in a ""downloadable content"" format. So choosing the prequel way, and throwing in the story of our favourite character, Ellie, Left Behind seem already the perfect choice.,In here, we get to see two perspectives, or let's say, two Ellies. One is already with Joel, slaying her way out of a mall. The other one is with Riley, her best friend, who, if you finished the campaign, you know how that story is going to end. Both stories don't work together quite as well as the narration in the campaign did, but it still has the touching moments you expect, and the quirky and quotable dialogue.,Gameplay is the same, intense, challenging and open-ended, but the DLC introduces a new feature into battle that is the one of ""Mixed enemies"". That means you have both, human enemies and infected, in a same room, giving you the choice of either going full-stealth one by one, or making them fight each other. Is a human near you? Throw a bottle near him, and let that clicker do its job. This makes the gameplay more tactical and surprisingly, more fun.,And of course, it is a beautiful DLC, just as the game, it pushes the PS3 to limits we have never seen before. So, in the end, Left Behind is short and a tad expensive (14.99 USD) but its two hour journey provides fans exactly what they want: More The Last of Us, and also a heart-warming story about two girls in this post-apocalyptic world whose story is both touching and devastating.",normal,2014-02-18,English,6,3,9
Neuroxic,"I should be giving this DLC a 9, but am scoring it higher because ND should be rewarded for the risk they took with regards to its pacing and content.,,After playing the Tibetan village scene in Uncharted 2 I realized that ND was capable of creating a AAA game with a minimal amount of combat where the main focus was dialog and exploration. This is the closest they've come to making one.,,The first 75% (around two hours) of Left Behind are nothing short of superlative. Having read the prequel comics I was ecstatic about the game's references to events in these, as I was to the fact that the protagonists are strong-willed non-sexualized young women. There's plenty of dialog yet it never seems forced or artificial, and there are many serious conversations about the characters lives and where they're heading.,,Like its story the game is beautiful and a few seconds into playing it my jaw had dropped as I was once again astonished at the level of graphics ND are able to get out of hardware bordering eight years of age, let alone the detail in their environments.,,For me however, the reason these first two hours stood tall above almost all AAA games I've played until now was the amount of combat: there were two encounters with infected and no encounters with humans. And this was perfect.,,They were segments in TLoU that nailed this (The opening section of the Fall chapter, the university, the sewers and the neighborhood) and are in fact my favorite parts of that game but overall I felt that TLoU had too much combat.,,Clearing room after room of zombies and goons is not fun, and in a devastated world I don't expect there to be many of each. This plausibility issue was my my chief problem with TLoU and the last 25% of Left Behind.,,There's too much combat in the DLC's penultimate chapter, and like TLoU ND still hasn't let go of one of their biggest sins: a difficulty spike at the end of a game. It's frustrating, ruins the pacing but above all signals to the player that game is coming to an end, causing instant loss of immersion.,,But as I mentioned at the beginning I forgave ND for these issues as they are SO close to creating a game with a focus on dialog and exportation.

UserScore,"The Last of Us: Left Behind Review:,Pros/ Good Points:,+ An outstanding story with unseen twists. Strong characters and character development. I think the DLC looks better than The Last of Us, but I'm probably wrong. Although it is undeniable (along with it's big brother) the best looking game of this generation. Amazing sound design. Increble and touching soundtrack by Gustavo Santaolalla, with the tracks being (again) used in the most appropriate moments. Great new twist to the combat, now letting you make the infected and survivors fight against each other.,Cons/ Bad Points:,- There's trophy bug that doesn't let me achieve the 100% completition of the DLC (the trophy is BFF). It's only 1 and a half hour long with exploring everything prolonging it to 2 hours. Though it is an incredible experience and I would pay anything for it, I know most people wouldn't and with that said, the 15 dollars price tag is a bit too expensive. Last combat scene felt forced.,Final Score and thoughts:,The Last of Us: Left Behind is a remarkable experience with some things that make it difficult to give it a 10.

GrumpyReviewer,"Another example of why Naughty Dog has become one of the most important (if not THE most important) developers of our generation. They take an almost perfect game and add a DLC that is ACTUALLY worth our money and time. Playing Left Behind was like playing Last of Us all over again - but having the whole experience in a nut shell: fear, adrenaline, laughter, tears, joy. These guys are not ""game makers""; they are alchemists, wizards, poets. I just cannot believe the amount of emotions they can squeeze in a 3 hours chapter; without mentioning a beautiful revelation, given in such delicate way, that made me silent and radiant. I only give 9 because this is too short; we need more, we need to see what's going on. Other than that, the only thing I could say is ""Thank You"".",normal,2014-02-17,English,16,6,9
TheRebel,"I never purchase DLC because it's usually unnecessary and it's a way for developers to exploit the consumer. However, The Last of Us is a phenomenal game, which has a lot of story left to tell. In this DLC, you play as Ellie before she gets bitten, and you play as Ellie after Joel gets injured.,,Ellie's adventure to help Joel:,In addition to the usual gameplay, there are multi-faction battles between humans, the infected, and Ellie. It makes the gameplay dynamic and allows you to play each battle differently. The only downside about this, is that you only deal with multiple enemies in about two different instances. Combat isn't the only thing this section includes; in fact, it contains an emotionally powerful story, depicting Ellie's desperation to find supplies for Joel. It exhibits her transformation from being an innocent girl, to a girl who is forced to kill in order to save another human being.,,Ellie exploring with Riley:,In this storyline, Ellie is exploring a ravaged mall with her best friend, Riley. This part has no battle sequences, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead, the focus is solely on their relationship. Playing through this section is a rewarding experience in many ways. As the player, you get to experience happiness, sadness, and many other emotions. The writing is believable and feels very realistic. The only gripe I have with this section, is the ending. I feel that it could have shown a bit more than what was offered.,,Pros:,-Multi-Faction Battles,-Excellent Writing,-Answers Questions from the Main Game,,Cons:,-Short DLC(2-3 Hours Long),,Verdict:,I recommend this DLC for any fan of The Last of Us.

I LOVE the Last of Us, and I'm happy I played it for the backstory, but $15 for less than 2 1/2 hours of gameplay feels like robbery.  This DLC needs more of what made TLoU great.

I just wanted to keep playing and in less than a day, I already completed it 2 times and watched it 1 time on Youtube. The music is once again amazing. Especially the song at the end of the story and begin of the credits is still going bouncing in my heart (yeah). After the darkness of the main story, I think it was smart to do something that showed how much fun you could still have. A carroussel is not really the most awesome thing in this world for people older than 8, but I loved looking at Ellie while she was on it. The acting is really convincing, especially the end when Ellie was crying.,I also liked all the links to our time, like the ""what's a face book?"" and all the twitter accounts and the sites (if you didn't know about that, you should google it).,It may be not as good as The Last of Us itself and it will probably not mess with my head for so long, but it's a DLC and that's an extra. It's an exceptional DLC that many companies can look at before they make one.,The Last of Us with Left Behind is something is something I will remember for the rest of my life and I'm really proud that this thing was made in the time I lived and played games.

Considering story parts, let’s be honest here, except for a few really good moments, namely two (and together they last for 3 minutes), it’s rather dull, if you’re 30 something male as myself. So, if you’re really into 13 year old girls and their problems - be my guest, otherwise - watch youtube walkthrough and you’ll not miss much. Sad, but true.

It's story is excellent, its gameplay is top-notch, and, even with the PS4 on the market, it still looks gorgeous.  That being said, I have a few caveats that stop me from giving it a 10/10.  It is a tad short, for starters.  Normally length is not a problem for me, but I feel as though the conclusion with the two girls was cut short.  Some of the combat, while awesome, felt a little forced as well.  Also, the ""reveal"".  I going to try to say this in as spoiler free a way as possible, but here goes nothing.  I don't like what they did with the reveal, mostly because I don't like it when a character is suddenly and dramatically changed in an way that had no foreshadow or hint.  Heck, if anything, we were led to believe the opposite.  But even so, I would have been fine with it if it had been developed (as in Gone Home).  To me, it felt like a cop out, and attempt to add more depth and characterization where there already was so much.  Otherwise, the story was brilliant, and perfectly written.

JohnWitten,"The Last of Us was an excellent game, and it did not need this DLC in the slightest, but I am still glad that this was created in order to add a little more to the story. If they do continue with a few more DLC packs, it would be interesting to see something prequel wise from several other supporting or main characters' perspectives, but it is equally nonessential to making such an excellent title better. Left Behind is a worthwhile addition to the lore of The Last of Us' universe without touching the ending, and that preservation of the ambiguity and mystery is why I enjoyed it the most. I enjoyed taking control of Ellie once more and seeing things through her originally more-innocent and naive perspective, sad though that was. That girl is gone now, but the story lives on.,,Concept: Single-player additional content that is meant to expand upon the universe of The Last of Us, and adds more flavor into Ellie's own backstory and personal life after the apocalypse and during it.,,Graphics: The graphical beauty of the main game continues in this additional content, and though it is on a technically last generation console, it still plays better than some Play Station 4 titles do with the new capabilities of that console.,,Sound: The characters may have been changed up slightly, but their voice acting and that of even routine encounters with strangers and adversaries is perfectly done and showcases Naughty Dog's attention to detail and willingness to craft top-notch work.,,Playability: The action is as gritty and memorable as any moments throughout The Last of Us, and the controls and moments blend together as well as any in the main content of the game. Definitely a memorable, if short experience.,,Entertainment: The writing and story itself are well-written, even if they don't have the time to reach such epic levels as the main story's content. The characters are cohesive and believable. The universe works well with this prequel added in for the benefit of fleshing more characters out. And overall, it is a very enjoyable experience that- if a bit superfluous, is definitely to be enjoyed by fans of the game for a decent price (your emotions, mostly).,,Replay Value: Moderate.,,Overall Score: 8.25",normal,2014-02-15,English,5,3,8
Pickle,"I praised several elements that up to this point, id like to think, make The Last of Us a revolutionary game, it’s story, and the subjects that the game talks about. Left Behind tries it’s best to recreate the true “emotional” atmosphere that the main game did, it is impressive visually, the animations and graphics are never something to complain of while speaking about this game, as a matter of fact, technically the game it’s outstanding. However, the complains begin to rise when talking about the development of the characters and the reasoning behind creating a parallel storyline.,,It is something that i can’t stand, when a developer decides to put effort into creating something utterly unnecessary for the final product. It begins with the game giving you a hindsight in a minor plot hole of the main game’s storyline, Joel gets hurt and Ellie has to find a way to cure him. It’s irrelevant to the storyline of Ellie and Ashley, the parts that i thoroughly enjoyed were the ones that truly showed at it’s full splendor how special and unique the relationship between the two friends used to be.,,Ellie trying to find the medication for the injured Joel, doesn’t add to anything in game, and as matter of fact it retracts from the experience. The messages are also not that cleverly hidden, it is predictable and sometimes sneeringly cheesy, the way that they exploit in a banal and indirect perception of what friendship is. Luckily this happens on the first minutes of the game, and vanishes away for the rest of the experience.,,There are some truly special slow moments that show perfectly what correlates between Ashley and Ellie, the crafting of moments of them getting into a photo booth while laughing, only to then shade away into them looking at each other for a moment, those are the kind of moments where you would love to be part of this experience.,The ending was somehow disappointing, it wasn’t necessarily a bad ending, but it goes without saying that this ending make use of every cliche in the book, while The Last of Us had a perfect ending in my opinion. This game just never clarifies or gives closure to the relation between Ashley and Ellie.,,The gameplay never forms part of the game, it feels pushed aside and gives a feeling of laziness. The first minutes you’re not going to be playing to the suspenseful, and dangerous game that you were used to play, it falls down to and spiral of absurd repetition, and oddly enough it happens in the awful, uninspiring section of Ellie sharing and empty care for Joel, it is almost like if each story was design by different people. The gameplay in the sections of Ellie and Ashley are beautiful, thoughtful, and extremely unique, even if they try to dumb down the game to plain simple interaction without any challenge whatsoever, it always feel fresh, and meaningful.,,It is insulting that someone in the development team decided to create a parallel storyline along side the beauty that it was Ellie’s and Ashley’s story, this game should have focus entirely in them and forgotten completely about an irrelevant “plot hole” of the game main’s storyline, that could’ve be easily filled with the mind of the player.",normal,2014-02-15,English,8,2,8

JackValentine,"When we approach ""Left Behind"", we have to ask ourselves, ""What if it's the best part of The Last of Us thus far?"",,I managed to avoid every other trailer aside form the thirty second reveal shown back in November. I find that nowadays, every trailer is a spoiler.,This made my experience all the more enjoyable.,,The downloadable story of about 3 hours, tells a prologue story of Ellie. Before leaving the quarantine zone. Before Joel. Before the Fireflies.,You play as Ellie on the very day that she was bitten, while her and a young friend named Riley explore an abandoned mall.,There was a lot more to the story than I could have ever expected, however, that's something that you must see for yourself to truly appreciate.,,One of the best parts about the new DLC, is the removal of a large part of the combat. One of the things that slightly frustrated me about the first game, was the fact that it seemed like killing people was the only thing allowing me to progress through the level.,This time around, it's down to just the narrative to drive the story. There are some of the mechanics that were intended to be used for combat purposes in the original game, that have been reworked in some of the most wonderful ways I could ever have imagined.,You also are given quite a bit of freedom to roam around the locations of the game, and there is a great sense of exploration that comes into play.,,I should comment on the length, and I cannot even express how frustrating it is to see registered critics docking points because it is relatively short. If critics could only see past the function of the game as a distraction and more as the piece of art that it is, they may realize that it is quality over quantity that matters, and always will be.,Not to even mention the fact that at around 3 hours (while I was taking my time to explore), I found it even then to be a little drawn out. But spending an extra half an hour with such wonderful characters is hardly a bad thing.,,Overall, The Last of Us: Left Behind, is a phenomenal addition to one of the greatest games of all time.,You should already know if you're interested in returning to the dark, harrowing world of Ellie and Joel, but if you are even slightly on the fence, just know that the $15 spent will not be wasted.,,A 10.,,Jack Valentine",normal,2014-02-14,English,13,6,10

RealMuthaF,"Just beaten Left Behind, and my verdict is as follows: This is a bit more (3 hours for me, on hard with all the exploration) of the same good the Last of Us we know, with all the brutal action, emotional scenes and touching moments. It is not a solid 10/10 because of two things: first, it's still a bit too short for the money asked, and second, it lacks the absolutely outstanding, crushing and unforgettable episodes like the prologue and the ending from the original. Nevertheless, it's still a quality DLC and a must-buy for the fans of the original. By the way, make sure you connect your Facebook account to the PS3 for this one, you'll get a something memorable for your wall after a certain moment in the playthrough.",normal,2014-02-14,English,17,10,9
ThaKevMan,"The only way to describe this DLC is a short but sweet (in every sense of the word) prequel that completely lives up to the 'Last of Us' pedigree set by Naughty Dog with the original game. A very endearing and, at times heartbreaking story where we meet Ellie before her adventures with Joel. We see a side of Ellie that was only hinted at in the main story. Playful and lighthearted, moody and sometimes silly; Just a typical teenage girl living in the world life has handed her. That's not to say this DLC is all cutesy fun and games. This is offset by how the story goes back and forth between this past-Ellie and the one we know from her time with Joel, in a very fluid manor that could be jarring but is not. There is still much action and tension to be had. This is a masterfully told story that will grab you and never let go, even after the trip is over. The gameplay mechanics will be very familiar, so jumping right in should be no problem for anyone who has played the main game.",normal,2014-02-14,English,11,6,9

kavilash,"to be honest its not a total 10/10 game but it deserves 9. i'm gonna give a quick review. the last of us left behind DLC explains a lot and gives the story of last of us complete support. and the 2 hour game goes around 3 hours if you are onto exploration. still not bad for a DLC. the short story is a small package but a nuclear bomb itself. and no need to listen to haters who say  ""I LOVE TLOU"" but gives 0 ratings. there are always fake reviews to spoil the credibility of the game. as you can see there are no negative critic ratings this proves the capability of TLOU: LB. no fan can give a score under 8 because the game is built by one of the most reputed gaming developers Naughty Dog. this DLC pack has all it needs!!!  -1 because i wished it was 3 hours long then it  would had summed up around 4 hours. anyways for the price i think this is the best DLC so far",normal,2014-02-14,English,8,4,9
hiwasafari,"Left behind was better than I expected. I thought that there was nothing more in the last of us that could impress because I loved the game and played 4-5 times. But left behind had it suprisses and I really enjoyed playing. One of the best singleplayer DLC I have ever played.,,+ Amazing story,+ Suprisses,+ solid length,+ Beauitul sound,+ Ellie",expanded,2014-02-14,English,18,7,9
NP-complete,"Left Behind keeps the good pacing of TLOU, wisely interleaving calm and tense moments. It has good action scenes, including some new cool combat mechanics (I bet we will see them in the forthcoming new multiplayer DLC). I really buy the silly childish playing part, it's refreshing and useful to set the mood of the player. The narrative quality matches the one of the original game. Clearly, this DLC is good and anyone who liked TLOU will like it. I only have a couple of criticisms: (a) even if it has some genuinely touching moments, in my case it didn't reach TLOU's peak emotional heights; (b) since it's a short experience (2-3 hours), the cost of each playing hour is double than in TLOU: $15/2.5h = 6 > 3 = $60/20h, not to mention TLOU multiplayer additional hours! You know, fan-oriented pricing policy consists in doubling... Finally, a (very minor) disappointment: Obviously, all players who completed TLOU expect some specific event to happen during this DLC. They won't be disappointed in this regard, but I think it's presented in a slightly inconclusive way, I expected a few more details before the scene ends! Do we need now a DLC of the DLC? Maybe at 4x price? ;-) Just kidding!",normal,2014-02-14,English,14,8,8
gabberguy,I was a huge fan of The Last of Us and have spent countless days replaying the story and multiplayer. I do not want com across negative as the story here is almost as heartwarming as the main game. But On survivor difficulty it is still a 3 hour add on that feels to short and too easy. That being said the controls and graphics are near perfect and some parts are just as tense as when I first played the game.,normal,2014-02-14,English,12,6,7
HeavyLead,"This dlc in no way was going to live up to my expectations of what the original game did. That being said I still enjoyed it a ton. It had those heartfelt moments that are scattered in the game, the point A to point B areas, same enemies, and same weapons. Naughty Dog didn't push the envelope with this one. This dlc felt very easy compared to the sequences with Ellie in the main game. I breezed through on Hard in 2.5 hours, only dying once. KINDA SPOILER: The addition that I did like about the content was the use of infected and hunters in the same space. You can now have a 3 way combat system with more options at your disposal. I often found it very satisfying to lure a pack of clickers at a few hunters and let them fight for dominance as I watched from afar. Other than that the story is uninteresting and very cliched despite how uncliche the original game came off as. I often found myself accurately predicting the future events before they unfolded in front of me. If you loved The Last of Us then by all means buy this dlc. Quality over quantity is what I would say about this package, but it appears that we're lacking a bit in both fields.",normal,2014-02-14,English,21,10,7
hgmalvo,"If you've played Last of Us, you've already played this DLC.  No, seriously, you've played it already.,,The narrative of the game is easily noticeable as that's the only real new thing it has to offer.  It's a ONE HOUR glimpse into Ellie's past.  Remember that friend of hers she talked about, and the incident leading up to her infection?  Well, this is it.  You get to experience a brief moment in her life before s**t went south.  So, what was Naughty Dog's answer to all the boring dialog scenes you have to sit through?  Replay some moments of the original game of course! :D   That's right folks, you get to enjoy playing that area of the game where Ellie is looking after Joel...again.  Granted, it's not exactly the same moments from the original, but close enough that it feels like deja vu rather than deja new.  While this part of the DLC may appear to be the foil to an otherwise boring task, rightfully so...that's exactly what it is.  It's unoriginal, unnecessary, and it reeks of a cash grab.  For all the things that Naughty Dog could have done, they chose to cut corners instead.  Sadly, diehard fans and non-paying-for-this-content reviewers are not going to be the people to caution you against a purchase like this.  So consider that one can purchase a theater ticket for less and squeeze more time out of the experience than this.",normal,2014-02-14,English,71,19,1
