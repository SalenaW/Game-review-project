MetaRogue,"The Last of Us is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Never before have I played a game so compelling and emotionally gripping. The narrative is brilliantly paced, constantly going in unexpected directions and keeping you on the edge of your seat, but what shines even more is how the characters are brought to life through the excellently written dialogue and outstanding voice acting. What cements this believability further is the choreography and animation of the moment-to-moment action.,,I had my doubts about Naughty Dog's ability to transition from the high octane action filled exploits of the Uncharted series to something considerably darker, but Naughty Dog handles everything with a level of depth, nuance and maturity that truly showcases their talents as master storytellers.,,I experienced the full spectrum of emotions with this game from start to finish and it is a rare achievement for a game to make me fully care about every character in the story and how each of their journeys respectively end. It's also important to note that I rarely play a game twice in quick succession, but I loved this game so much that I made an exception.

rallianto,"A true masterpiece. Excels in almost every way a game can. Greatest part is the story telling. Weakest part is the gameplay itself. While the game sometimes is straight up boring to play, the amazing story is keeping you sucked in. Never have we seen such a character development in a game before, and never have we felt the story touch us like this before. Graphics are also amazing.,Also, the greatest part is the lack of identity politics, unlike it's sequel.,While this game is the height of what ND could achieve, this is probably one of the most interesting and innovative games ever made.,And then, the sequel, TLOU2 is the bottom for what a game can be! It's the worst game in the entire history of games. It is what happens, when you sell your sell and make your games about pushing a political message, rather than making a good game with a good story. TLOU2 is not even a game, it's a political message. It's the message ""you better hate Christianity"". The message ""you better hate men"". The message ""you better hate God"". ""Or you are a bigot"".,,Neil Drunkman are telling you to hate God, hate Christianity, hate men, hate society, hate the right leaning and endorse the left leaning. And if you don't agree you are a bigot. Yes, you! If you don't agree with Neil Drunkman on politics, you are a bigot! And if you buy this piece of propaganda, you are forced to play as a ""transgender"" (made up word) and you are forced to see your most beloved characters die in humiliating ways. Everything you loved about TLOU are destroyed and humiliated in the sequel. If you look at ""professional ratings"" for TLOU2 they are all 10/10. That's a joke. That's Sony paying off the the ""professionals"". If you look at regular people (who paid and bought the game to play it), they all give it 1/10. Because it's trash. It has nothing to do with the original. Joel is being killed of by a feminist transgender, to show that men are out and strong and independent women are in. We need to kill the men now, and let females rule. We need to kill of Christians because they are evil, and we need to endorse satanism and homosexuality and ""transgender"" people. We need to endorse men become women, and women becoming men. And if you don't, remember, YOU ARE THE BIGOT!!! **** Naughty Dog the worst game company of all time",normal,ps3,2020-12-06,English,0,0,9,train

BradfootGaming,"Disclaimer: 1st playthrough in 2020.,,I found myself enjoying the story and characters more and more as the game went on.  By the end I was interested in them,  The 1st half or 60% I was not interested, it felt bland and kind of boring.  I'm glad I stuck it out until the end, it was a positive experience overall. I noticed some bugs early on too.  It told me how to craft a healh kit when I didn't have the supplies to craft a healthkit so I had to play with huge block letters in the middle of the screen until I had the supplies needed.  Another one where the game directed you to just run for the exit, Ellie needed to jump through a window before I could go through.  She got hung up on the environment and was glitching for a long time while I had to waste all ammo and supplies on an endless zombie rush.  It was clearly not meant to be an ammo using spot and I was severely handicapped for the next few scenes.,,Overall a decent game,  my two thoughts through most of the game were ""Uncharted is much better than this"" and ""where are all the zombies.""",normal,ps3,2020-09-24,English,0,0,7,train

The story is about the relationship between Joel and Ellie which is developed flawlessly and at a perfect pace through well-timed story beats, relatable dialogue, environmental storytelling, and even combat. Moments of darkness are offset by moments of light, both that contribute to the narrative. Every single side character Joel and Ellie come across strengthens their personal motivations, their bond, all while having a believable arc of their own. Combat fits the world perfectly, and Ellie's scrappiness is conveyed perfectly through how she develops during combat sequences. The development of Joel and Ellie's father/surrogate daughter relationship feels very real, relatable, and honest, and the ending will have you asking yourself morally complex questions.

RafaelHeldt,"What The Last of Us has that others games don't? The combat and gameplay are great, but no exceptional, the graphics are just gorgeous, as Naughty Dog always makes, the story is amazing and the storytelling top notch, but not for a 10. Then, what is it? The short dialogues and expressions between the characters and their development. This game has some of the greatest character's development, and if you don't pay attention to little things, expressions, faces, and short dialogues between Ellie and Joel, you won't see how great this game really is. Walking around the cities, abandon houses and buildings, listening and learning with the characters, as you are part of that, as you are also growing with them. The most significant scene that express the core of the game, is the one where Ellie and Joel see some giraffes and pet them. That scene seems to be just a simple and nice part of the game, but it has a deep meaning behind it, expressing the changes and the development of the world and of Ellie and Joel, as they now move on and continue to walk, with only the future ahead. Seeing how the city that once was full of people, which now has animals walking freely around it, makes you wonder if the future will be good or bad, but they move on. And we also move on, taking step by step to the future where we belong. The Last of Us ending is one of the most discussed endings: was Joel right or wrong? It all depends how you look at it. He was not wrong, but he was not right. He was a cold man, he was broken and fixed on the past. Ellie showed him how the present and future can be good, and he moved on. Ellie saved him, and he saved Ellie for his own well being. I can't say I don't understand him, as I would do the very same thing. We are all humans after all.",normal,ps3,2020-07-24,English,0,0,10,train
piuscorvus,"I have never been a fan of games with horror zombie apocalypse topics. I played some of them such as The Evil Within games, tried one Resident Evil game and few others. The common thing for all those games (in my opinion) was that they are very successful in making you scared and uncomfortable but when it comes to the storylines - they were all so thin and weak, sometimes even pointless. I am fine with gore and fear but if that is the only point in the game then I do not find it really interesting.,I have been avoiding playing The Last of Us because I thought it is just another zombie game but when I finally started playing I saw after two hours of gameplay that this game is completely different. This is the first game with such topic (zombie outbreak) that I liked and it definitely is the best game with zombies and one of the best games that I have ever played and that is because it only uses the zombie apocalypse as an atmosphere in which context lies a story about Joel, the adult and Ellie, fourteen year old girl, who are on their journey through the country. The game puts an accent on the story and does not have a gameplay based on infinite shooting at zombies, or how they call them in the game, infected. It is far from that but the gameplay is far from a piece of cake and it should also satisfy gamers who are into action and shooting, especially if they select harder difficulty modes.,I played both PS3 and PS4 version of this game and visually it is one of the best looking games for PS3. Even in 2020, 7 years after it was released, this game still looks very nice being put next to some other good looking PS4 titles. The PS4 remastered version has a little visual improvements such as full HD resolution and more fps.,Speaking of a gameplay, The Last of Us does not bring many innovations - it rather improves some stuff that we already saw in third person action-adventure games. The gameplay perfectly combines exploration and combat with cutscenes without overdoing each of those. You can play this game in many ways. You can be aggressive and shoot everything at your sight but you can also sneak and be quiet. There are many ways of passing through the areas and for the most part you can really choose if you want to assassinate your enemies or find a way around.,Through the game you will find different sorts of weapons and there is a crafting system allowing you to make improvised bombs and melee weapons.,Another part of a gameplay is walking and exploration followed by interesting dialogs.,The Last of Us has a very fine acting, one of the best I saw in video games, which an emotional story of this game certainly needs, a story that most of the players would breathlessly follow until the end.",normal,ps3,2020-07-24,English,0,0,10,train
Svenom46,"This is hands-down the best video game since probably Final Fantasy VII back in 1997. Not only was it graphically stunning (it's still impressive 7 years and a console generation later), it was pretty revolutionary at the time. The combat and game play was so far ahead of everything else. The way the environment was incorporated into melee combat especially stood out to me at the time.,,The story was absolutely captivating. The characters were likable and well-written. You empathized with them and you felt their pain for the choices they had to make. This was one of those once in a generation games that showed you what a genre could be instead of just a new skin on the same style and format.,,Crafting items wasn't overwhelming with 10 different upgrade trees and a convoluted system that required you to wander around doing side quests for hours before you moved on. It was just enough to make sense and for pretty much everything to be useful.,,Fighting infected enemies was genuinely terrifying and stressful. Human enemies followed predictable paths and the AI wasn't great, but each fight always felt personal and intense.,,This game is just phenomenal; one of the best of all-time.",normal,ps3,2020-07-23,English,0,0,10,train

Não jogá-lo seria o mesmo que ter comprado um livro para ser um peso de papel.,,---> Pontos positivos:,- Excelente desenvolvimento dos personagens principais.,- Conseguiu criar uma atmosfera de pós-pandemia muito convincente. Diferente de jogos do mesmo gênero, consegue criar no jogador um sentimento de tensão constante e urgência.,- O sistema de encontrar recursos e ter que ""craftar"" os itens com os reagentes certos nos locais certos agregam a trama do jogo,- A partir da trama é possível extrair uma série de temas filosóficos que continuam pertinentes no mundo contemporâneo. Ex: homem é o lobo do homem; política; fragilidade da vida humana; egoísmo; amor; sacrifício,- gráficos realistas,- excelente trilha sonora,- excepcional trabalho de consistência entre dublador e personagem. Ex: a voz da dubladora da ellie encaixou certinho com a personagem.,,--> Pontos negativos:,- Existência de uma DLC que deveria ser parte do jogo original. Quem jogou o game em fase teve que comprar a DLC por fora. NaughtyDog lançou o jogo de modo incompleto e se você quiser a experiência completa terá que pagar 2x pelo mesmo jogo.,- Incoerência entre armas no jogo e na vida real. Ex: você dá um tiro de shotgun num cidadão a uma distância de 2m e ele não morre com um tiro.",normal,ps3,2020-07-21,Portuguese,0,0,10,train

I can confidently say that the development for Joel and Ellie made the characters come to life in a way that I was able to find a deep emotional attachment to.

Disko-Kjell,"The Last of Us is truly a cinematic masterpiece in video gaming. The production and competence from the people behind the scenes elevates this game beyond even some movies and tv shows. The acting from the cast is incredible and truly is award winning, and the story they're involved in puts both the characters and the player in harrowing and disturbing situations. The story of a man transporting a teenage girl through a post-apocalyptic America works because the interaction and chemistry between the two is excellent. The gameplay works fluently as well, with the UI not getting in the way of what is happening. All of the player's actions in game happens in real time, which means that the game doesn't pause when you're sorting through your bag and crafting or swapping weapons. It just adds to the dreadful gameplay and forces the player to act fast. The different enemies give alternating methods of confronting levels. Humans move faster but are easily vulnerable, while infected are slow but are harder to kill and deal more damage at a closer range. With the different enemy types included, it keeps the player on their toes. The pacing doesn't let go of the player's interest, making both the plot and gameplay moving consistently. The only pacing issue I have is early on, right after the prologue, where it feels like the plot doesn't move at the speed or works as wonderfully as it should be. However, it's only a brief period of around 45 minutes, but it should still be mentioned. The ending evokes emotions and themes rarely brought up and questions the player's morality and thinking, which makes for a great ending. The game also comes with a multiplayer with a surprising amount of layers to the gameplay and design. It involves a lot of teamwork and communication with gunfights that feel desolate and tense, giving it a realistic feeling of what would probably happen in real life. In conclusion, The Last of Us is a one of a kind video game that deserves all the praise it gets. With its excellent singleplayer and surprisingly fun multiplayer, this is absolutely a must have for everyone.",normal,ps3,2020-07-07,English,0,0,10,test

ZetaZ98,"A must play for anyone that owns a Playstation 3, this game is proof that games can tell stories just as well if not BETTER than film can. A story like this hits home so much stronger by putting you in the role of the protagonist rather than just watching it play out. And make no mistake, the gameplay is nothing to shrug off either, with a solid design that only becomes problematic a few instances.,,The Last of Us does an excellent job keeping its gameplay interesting through the entire run by developing encounters and scenarios that build on each other and become more challenging without mindlessly throwing more enemies at you. There is a logic and system to the increasing challenge and there are always multiple means to victory.,,The game suffers however from a number of bugs, glitches, and errors. The most infuriating of which are the broken trophies that do not work on many copies of the game, and the fact that the game does not carry over collectible progress between playthroughs. You want the find everything trophy? You need to do it all in one run, and you better hope the trophy doesnt glitch out or you are doing it all over again.,,There are also multiple issues with consumables and resources being lost after dying/restarting an encounter, and other optimization issues.",normal,ps3,2020-07-01,English,0,0,8,test

Jak&Dexter's tetralogy was a hit on PS2. Uncharted's trilogy is a hit for PS3... and now this... The Last of Us is a masterpiece and will change developers approach to game development.,,TLOU main characters are the most human, realistic and relatable 3D models in gaming history.,It is just incredible how real every dialogue feels.,The plot tself is very simplistic, something we've actually seen over and over again... But never with such quality and attention to details: It's a story narrated by character's progression.,The gameplay, again, is nothing new. But it's execution is almost flawless.,The level design is amazing, among the best ever, even if sometimes it realies a bit too much on boring and repetitive set pieces to progress (the only flaw in the game).,The graphics are incredible too, this is simply the best looking game ever done - up until PS3 of course - that can easily rival with many early/mid PS4 games too.,And the music... guys...

NoodlePsychosis,"A masterclass in video game storytelling. The Last Of Us is the next big step for Naughty Dog after Uncharted, and its a showcase of everything they've learned making Uncharted, channeled into a new IP. The storytelling is better, the gameplay is more varied,  and the character interactions and world building are so well done its easy to get attached to the world and the characters in it, despite how unforgiving that very same world is.,,The gameplay while tense, can be pretty unfair in regards to the enemy placements. Perhaps some players will enjoy the feeling that death is always around the corner,  but getting killed by the tiniest mistake is a bit overly oppressive for my taste, going to near perfectionist lengths at some points. This difficulty is made a bit worse because the aiming controls are a bit clunky, making players take longer to successfully aim at enemies, thus more likely to get hit.,,Despite the game mechanics being just fine in my eyes, it is still absolutely worth putting up with for the story. Like I said, that is the best part of the game and what makes this game stand out so well in a age of cinematic video games. It knows when to be dramatic, when to show you the few glimmers of hope left in the world, and more importantly, when to stay silent and let a scene breathe, which takes skill to do. The ending in particular is a masterclass of storytelling, leaving itself in a shocking but logical place, with plenty of room for player interpretation, which I really liked.,,Is a zombie apocalypse an original idea? No. Is a father/daughter story an original idea? No. Its the quality in which this is all done. The love and care placed into the environment, story and characters that shines through and gives an experience that is hard to ever forget. Last Of Us is not an original idea.

CoreGamer1408,"This is the most overrated game I have ever played on the PS4. Full of scripted cheating BS that forces you into stupid insane avoidable situations. Oh and the combat is so unrefined to the point of jank. What is with the slow cumbersome wobbly aim of a geriatric in a care home. So like have the developers really ever picked up a bow/pistol/rifle and shot one ffs? Oh wow melee that glitches out with really shoddy camera angles. This the best you got Naughty Dog?,,Seriously NFW Joel should be dead round about the horse section, but hey no major spoilers. I liked the gruff Joel character enough, but Ellie the swearing edgy mary sue teen character not so much. Another teenage character is in the game and yes I was convinced that they was just a teenager. Not going on forty like Ellie. Hyped game, scripted idiocy, unconvincing character development on the Ellie part. With shoddy gameplay mechanics. Nope not impressed by this game with NFW 200+ awards.,,What was even Ellie and Joels realistic stakes in all this story hey? If Ellie was just the next job or a surrogate daughter neither status played a deciding factor as regards to morals or ethics. Simply put an adult has a duty of care for a child under there supervision. That adult has a moral and ethical position to keep a child alive under their care. Joel or anyone else could not ethically or morally put that type of certain adult choice and burden on child, because they are still a child, ffs...,,So yeah with meh/jank gameplay and no real high stakes story dilemmas.

Konoba7,"A lot of people call it overrated but the truth is that is not, here are the reasons.,-Gameplay, this game takes the third-person shooter formula and makes it a more slow paced game, it challenges you to be resourceful and minimalist, this is on point with the narrative and the context of being a post apocalyptic world. Also, to really think your approach before you take action in an encounter. There is a great system in terms of management in accessing the resources and crafting them is quick.,-Story, the connection that grows between Joel and Ellie thought the whole game is incredible, it makes you care about them and the people that they meet in their journey. From the complexity of Joel, a character that lost hope and struggles with more than surviving, to Ellie a girl that was born in this new age of humanity that fears to be alone. And of course that ending.... a philosophical question that makes you think of what is right or wrong.,Another important aspect is the world around them, how society has changed and show their worst in some cases, the different groups of people and their philosophies like the fireflies or the cannibals.,-Graphics/Visuals, what Naughty Dog managed to do with a PS3 system is unreal, a lot of people cannot believe that the game could even run on that machine, it will hold for a long time.,-Multiplayer, which is the most fun I had with a multiplayer, it's addicting and very rewarding. Every match is the equivalent of a day in your small community of people, which you have to provide food and take care of, you do this by getting resources in the match, doing some challenges, etc.,It is a masterpiece, one of a kind experience in a lifetime and a full guarantee of quality.",normal,ps3,2020-05-29,English,1,0,10,train

Once you get used to the game play and settle in, the journey of Joel and Ellie absorbs you, and you can't put it down.  Joel is the ultimate anti-hero, a character who is actually not a particularly good person underneath, but you become attached to him, from the loss of his daughter through to his growing paternal love for his young associate.  Ellie is scripted perfectly, never an annoyance and played with the confidence of a young woman who has been through a lot, but still has the teenage naivety that you would expect of a 14 year old.

Iron_Moose_Kunt,"Do you like games where you watch more cutscenes than play? Do you like games where the NPC companion characters constantly break emersion? Do you like watching the same animations over and over again? Do you like nonsensical plots? Well then this ladder climbing simulator is for you!,,The Last of Us is a game with terrible pacing that somehow manages to feel disjointed and also repetitive. The game play is either slowly walking around, slowly crawling around, climbing up and down ladders thousands of times, watching cutscenes, or charging at guys while getting shot in the face multiple times and then insta-killing baddies by stabbing them in the arm with broken glass... You can also sneak up on people and strangle them so you can watch the 15 second strangle animation over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over while other baddies wander around feet away completely oblivious. The stealth system is stupid and broken.,,PLOT SPOILERS: The game starts with Joel's (the character you play as) daughter being killed during the opening stages of a zombie apocalypse. (Such innovation, much wow!) 20 years later Joel meets Ellie (a girl who is the same age as his daughter when she died) who is immune to the zombie fungus. You then spend 20 hours playing a ladder climbing simulator to get Ellie to a hospital so they can use her to make a cure. At the end Joel murders an entire hospital's worth of doctors and nurses working to cure the fungus because the procedure they are going to do on Ellie to create a cure will cause her death. Joel thus dooms humanity. I think the game is trying to make some kind point about humanity being bad here but it gets lost in the ladder climbing and nonsensical plot.

psylife,"The first thing to note is that the game is surprinsingly short (Hard playthrough) - The absence of uniquely crafted set pieces points towards the fact that the game might have had a lower budget than previous naughty dog productions. Gameplay wise, you are looking at a competent stealth action game, but that does nothing new to advance the genre.,,Let's be clear, as far as stealth options are concerned, you get to chose between throwing a brick, or a bottle, that's it. There are no exciting environmental opportunities to leverage, no interesting situational obstacles to deal with, and boredom sets in as, you deal with fairly identical situations, over, and over. Think of Uncharted, with extra boring interruptions, walking sections, and with the fun action bits removed. They also got rid of the puzzles too since you now get to play with bricks and ladders.,,The crafting and looting is competently handled, but there is really nothing in terms of gadgets or skill tree worth praising above and beyond the competition.,,And that's my problem, in the light of all of these observations, it is difficult for me to accept the praise the game has garnered. Maybe an exceptional scenario and plot could have justified the praises, but considering how cliche and predictable the story is, it is that much more difficult to reconcile myself with its critical success.,,Yes, the acting, music, presentation and production value is a cut above the competition, but as far as 2013 release games, I can think of so many games that easily outclass The last of us in terms of game and level design, pacing, mechanics, and player agency. Games such as Tomb raider, Blacklist, GTAV, not only do more, but they do it better - and if we wanted to draw a comparison with a game that more closely resembles the last of us, Spec ops: The line is the more successful of the two in realizing both its game-play and story-telling ambitions.,,The last of us remains a moderately enjoyable game, it does have a few saving graces in terms of scenario and game-play (like the hunting sandbox at the beginning of the winter chapter), but it is far too repetitive and limited in scope to be considered anything above the best the competition has to offer. It is also worth noting that 2 of Resident evil 4's most memorable, fun, and iconic game-play moments were ""borrowed"" by Naughty dog, though not as well executed as in Capcom's masterwork.,,As a videogame, The last of us only truly excels at mimicking what has previously been done better on film and TV, yet does very little in terms of intelligent design, and interactive story telling.",normal,ps3,2020-04-01,English,4,3,6,train

Tregedy doon strikes and Joels's daughter  is catelessly shot and killed in the first 5-10 mintes. Never have zI felt such loss while playing a video game. This leads Joel on a downward Spiral.

Cloud302,"I've been a gamer for over two decades now (ever since the original Nintendo), and I can firmly and confidently say that this is THE best game I've ever played.,,This game without a doubt deserves 5/5. I feel that anyone that gives it less didn't get what it was trying to do. This isn't a standard video game. It's primary purpose is to tell you a story. An interactive story, where you actually feel like you're there with the characters, experiencing everything with them as they experience it. It's something books and movies can't quite pull off, and is video game specific. Even among games, it's extremely rare that a truly successful and well-done interactive narrative can be pulled off so successfully. Everything really matters.,,The only downside I can think of is that there is a ton of swearing, and a pretty decent amount of violence, so this game isn't for the little ones below 10 years. Also, the AI does odd stuff occasionally. But virtually everything else is virtually flawless, breath-taking, heart-breaking, and intense. The writing, art & environments, acting, and music are all above top-notch. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, whether it be due to wondering what's lurking around the corner, or to hear what interesting tid-bit your in-game companions will say next.,,This game is for anyone and everyone that appreciates a good story. If you've ever enjoyed a fictional book, movie, or video game, in your entire life, you owe yourself this experience. Do what you have to do, to become the last of us. You won't regret it.,,P.S. You should really read the very short prequel comics first (before playing the game), written by the head writer of the game. They're official storyline, and really do add a lot of little neat things and details to the game that you wouldn't appreciate or would miss otherwise",normal,ps3,2019-02-27,English,0,0,10,train

Polygoncrafter,"The Last Of Us...A game that I liked the first time I played and finished it. The second time though, I realized that this is a game you spend 80% - 90% of your time crouching and sneaking that it becomes a chore and becomes boring. No replay value. The game is heavily stealth based which is not bad, but this game's stealth mechanics is a poor one. Maybe if they have included setting up traps and commanding your ai partner in the gameplay, it would have been more fun and engaging. Just because the story is dark and it's an emotional game, doesn't mean the gameplay shouldn't be. I think the only reason why a lot of people like this, me included is because of the voice acting and how real the characters are. But as a game, it doesn't offer much in the gameplay department.

Pinkpansylove,"This is not one of the best games I have played but instead is one of the best I have experienced. The last of us is not a fun game to play. Levels are very linear and tedious, with clunky movement and gunplay. Note that clunky gameplay is usually a positive for horror games (resident evil, silent hill, etc); for some reason here it feels like a crutch.,,The standouts of this game are instead in the story, soundtrack, and acting. The story is actually quite standard for a zombie story; it has expected plot twists but it is done right so it is still very enjoyable. The main reason it works is the phenomenal motion capture acting, especially by Troy Baker as Joel. He brings a weighted performance as a damaged character who has experienced loss and desperate survival for 20 years. I would consider him to be on par with Andy Serkis from this performance alone. That isn't to ignore Ashley Johnson's equally important role as Ellie, our second protagonist. We get to see our two characters develop together as the game continues, done in a non-rushed and satisfying way.,,The soundtrack is beautiful and heartfelt, composed and played with a lot of soul and care.",normal,ps3,2018-08-17,English,0,0,8,train
Hannibaal,"Mediocridad muy bien producida.,,Este juego está muy sobrevalorado y creo saber la causa de que lo esté. En una época de decadencia de los videojuegos en la que las grandes producciones son casi siempre juegos de disparo en primera persona o juegos de mundo abierto como GTA, es evidente que sorprendió que una gran producción AAA fuera un juego como TLO mas parecido a una aventura con ciertos toques de survival horror, además de eso TLO fue sobresaliente en el realismo de sus personajes y pionero en la crudeza y madurez de su historia. En todo eso TLO era un juego superior a la media, y es entendible que fuera tan alabado.,,Pero eso no puede hacer que obviemos la verdad, y la verdad es que TLO deja mucho que desear en su apartado jugable, el juego está plagado de escenas de video y a veces cortan demasiado el ritmo, el apartado jugable es sorprendentemente complejo para los estandares de un AAA como las basuras que produce EA, Ubisoft o la propia Naugthty con su basuresca saga Uncharted, si, eso es cierto, pero no deja de ser un juego simple, se consigue dominar en poco tiempo y en cuanto a dificultad tampoco la tiene, yo no soy un buen jugador y lo pasé en la máxima dificultad que permitía en la primera partida sin demasiados problemas, solo los tuve con algún molesto cript que por cierto abundan mucho en este juego. A nivel jugable como digo es un juego muy normalito y sin profundidad, es mas, tiene cosas vergonzosas como por ejemplo que los objetos para distraer a los enemigos se regeneren en el escenario, es vergonzoso. Otro fallo es cuando quieres avanzar con sigilo y la estúpida IA de Ellie aparece delante de enemigos y estos no reaccionan, como si Ellie fuera invisible, eso en en parte se carga la ambientación,,Otra cosa que no se comenta mucho es el apartado artístico, para mi especialmente los enemigos dejan mucho que desear y la historia en general no deja de ser otro clon de peliculas de zombis o post apocalipticas, en este caso es muy evidente que este juego está muy inspirado en peliculas como The Road.,,TLO es una mediocridad muy bien producida sobre todo gracias a un presupuesto enorme con el que no pueden contar la mayoría de estudios.   6/10",normal,ps3,2018-08-03,Spanish,0,0,6,train

While the premise of the infection and all that is cool, the game as a whole is just a vessel for wringing emotion out of the player.

Joel begins the story by losing a daughter, conveniently the same age and personality type as a girl he'll meet a decade later.  Characters who outlive their usefulness to the emotion extortion literally reveal they are infected less than a minute before they are killed off.,,And don't get me started on gameplay.  While what's there is good and polished, it is ruined by being completely, and inexplicably, segregated into four distinct types of games: 1) area traversal/puzzle/stealth, 2) combat versus humans, 3) combat versus zombies, and 4) boss encounters.

Alex_Pilgrim008,"""The Last of Us"" is arguably the best PS3 game ever made. It's a bleak post-apocalyptic survival game that recalls ""The Road"", ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Children of Men"". Developed by Naughty Dog (the makers of ""Uncharted""), this is interactive storytelling of the highest order. The plot is a simple one; gruff loner Joel must escort Ellie, a feisty, but wise girl, to a rebel group's headquarters located hundreds of miles away. However, the task is a possibly deadly one due to the psychotic gangs, kill squads and ""zombies"" that now roam the United States. Surprisingly, the game is quite profound. Writing, acting and directing are all top notch and the presentation resembles a great Hollywood drama.,,Gameplay-wise, ""The Last of Us"" is similar to ""Manhunt"", the controversial Rockstar game from 2003. At times, stealth is needed to survive, while the gunplay and brawling are grounded to resemble realism. As you progress in the game, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and abilities by collecting building materials and medicine. The urban and countryside environments are not only expansive, but highly-detailed. The abandoned cities have a convincing, decayed look. They all contain scattered letters, pictures and comics that give the illusion people once lived in them. The world of ""The Last of Us"" is a very lonely, depressing and haunting one. But the colorful characters, involving story and excellent performances will keep you hooked.,,The game also includes good competitive multiplayer that ties into the story, but the single player campaign is what makes it great. It's an artistic triumph that elevates the genre and really stands on a plane of its own. The script could've been made by filmmakers and won several movie awards. In fact, the 2017 horror movie ""It Comes at Night"" borrows much inspiration from ""The Last of Us"". If you've never played it, then you'll be blown away. It's a masterpiece.

The dialogue and voice acting are absolutely amazing, though I would have liked a tiny bit more diversity with the dialogue choices you make a la Mass Effect. That would have been the cherry on the cake.,,Gameplay-wise, that's where the game lost a few points for me. The gameplay mechanic is very well done and I like that you can upgrade your character's skills and weapons. But the level design is somewhat bland, for the exception of a couple of chapters that stands out. The puzzles, if they are considered puzzles, are absolute no brainers, which is a shame for this type of game. The combat is kind of unbalanced, in my opinion. I don't like the fact that clickers and bloaters can one-hit kill you. Yes I know you can upgrade your shiv to be able to counter the clickers' grapple, but it should have been by default anyway, knowing that you can only carry 3 breakable shivs at anytime anyway! Also, I don't like the fact that it takes 3-4-5 bullets/arrows to take down a human enemy. I mean, the game tries it's best to look as realistic as possible, but man if I snipe a guy in the head, he should die, even if he has a helmet on.  If I shoot you with a shotgun at point blank, you die, Kevlar vest or not! If I impale you with an arrow, you are not in top shape condition to fight afterwards, you are either very wounded or dying! Even on higher difficulty levels, it should not take more bullets than it realistically needs to kill a non super-human in a game. What should change with difficulty levels is the amount of damage you can take and how smart the AI is. That's a mistake so many game devs make and it would make the game's battles much more interesting, especially since one hit stealth kills are so important in this game. I don't see why ranged battles should be any different.,,The music does an awesome job at setting the mood right at any situation. And the sound effects are top notch.,,Multiplayer is also a cool addition, though not necessary to enjoy the game! The meat of the game definitely resides in it's single player mode.,,Overall, The Last of Us is great game, if not one of the best this year, but I do not believe it deserves all the praise it has been given by the press.

privatehudson,"As a long standing PC gamer, this is one of the games I'd heard massive hype about from my console owning friends, it was in their opinion the best game on the PS3 and one of the best games ever. Now that PS3s have come down in price massively, I shelled out £30 for one second hand, and picked this up for £6, so the question is was it worth it?,,The simple answer is absolutely. It has some fantastic acting, especially from the actors playing Joel, Ellie and Bill (same guy who played Dan from Deadwood, perfect casting choice!), the storyline is amazing and the gameplay is for the most part absolutely spot on. The combat is a mix of stealth or full on guns blazing mayhem, but if you choose the latter then I wish you luck because ammunition and supplies are in very short supply here, as you'd expect in an apocalypse. There's enough variety in the combat and enemies that it never really gets boring, and the human enemies especially are for the most part very intelligent. Once you're spotted, or if you open fire, they will hunt you down, flank you and attack in large groups to overwhelm you.,,Without giving any of the story away it really does make you think and long to know more. There's not massive amounts of clunky exposition, like any good story teller, the writers give you the basic outlines and information, and enough about the characters that you can fill in the rest. Ellie is especially a nice change in a game - a female character that is neither a damsel in distress or a hard faced killer, but often a mix of the two, struggling to get by in a world where everything seems out to kill you. Joel is a broken man who finds his way back towards his old personality towards the end of the game.,,There is one or two things I didn't like about the game. It does feel a little linear at times, forcing you along a specific path, however although you have to pass through a certain street or building, your path through it to deal with your enemies is very much left to yourself. I also found some of the puzzles a little repetitive and simple, but that allowed you to concentrate on the storyline presented.,,Two final things I thought they did very well:,,A second playthrough really pays off as you know what will happen later in the game. For example, about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through you meet a boy called Sam and his brother Henry and at one point walk through a toy shop. Sam picks up a transformers style toy, but Henry tells him to put it down as its unecessary weight. If you've played through to the end you'll know that Ellie picked up that toy. On my second playthrough I noticed Ellie hovering near it when the others were leaving the shop, but the toy was still there. I had to turn for a moment, and when I turned back she was running out of the room. The toy had gone. It was a small detail, but a fun one,,With the exception of the Firefly pendants, the collectibles and achievements make sense and tie into the storyline. The comics are for Ellie, the manuals that increase health kits or grenade radius are military manuals, the artifacts are poignant messages left by people such as notes to a missing family member or a newspaper cutting about a part of the outbreak. They don't feel forced and add something to the story. Not only that but you can prompt additional conversations if you take your time and see the right prompts. Some of these even link to the artifacts. It feels like there's a point to hunting them down beyond simple playstation trophies. The pendants are the only exception to this, with the exception of one in particular owned by Ellie, they serve no purpose beyond something to look for.,,The quibbles are minor though, the game is brilliant and worth every high score it has been awarded. It won't be for everyone, but the facts don't lie, this game gets all the applause because it deserves it.",normal,ps3,2017-07-22,English,1,0,9,train
BaldwinsNutsack,"While it may not be the 'best game of all time' as it is often described, The Last of Us is one video game in a rare strain of titles that serve as top-notch examples of what makes a great gaming experience. If you know someone who doesn't get the excitement and popularity surrounding the video game industry, and you want to show them as many of the reasons why as possible in one go, this would make a good option. The narrative is deep and emotionally compelling, the presentation is as cinematic as a film with long running sessions feeling comparable to binge watching a premium channel television show. The score, effects and atmosphere mesh with the environments and contexts throughout to alternately show beauty, horror, action, thrills, laughs, sentiment. The game mechanics are similarly multilingual, providing samples of RPG and TPS gameplay, platforming, stealth etc.,,Yet among these strengths lie the weaknesses: while it would be unfair to coin the phrase ""jack of all trades, master of none"", it does sum up how I feel about the broad reach of TLOU. With so many strengths, some are bound to be weaker than others and none can be mind-blowing on their own. However, the game is still a wonder in that it is the sum of all it's positives working in tandem. Also, even the biggest weak points are still far from 'bad'. There is a constant stream of goodness, but ultimately this is not a 10/10 for me.",normal,ps3,2017-07-19,English,1,0,9,train

BlakDak666,"The Last of Us is definitely a great game to play and with all of the talk about it even to this day it is very good to see Naughty Dog craft a game worth discussing still to this day. The biggest thing I want to say is it isn't a masterpiece. I know many would go on record and say that it is, but there are some problems with the game that I think need worth addressing because blind eyes for this game can really make a whole community blind.,,The pros I can easily give is the story is decent, BUT HOW IT'S TOLD IS OUTSTANDING. The acting for the game is nothing short of fantastic and if we include Naughty Dog's Uncharted series then the Last of Us destroys that already great cast with great grounded realist conversation.,,The combat is far more grounded and I love the stealth in this unlike the first three Uncharted games. There's a weight to crawling around and hiding behind things to avoid detection and get the drop on enemies. The frantic melee swings, the gunshots and flinching from shots is very brutal and great. It's not super deep, but I appreciate the crafting system that allows you to share resources to make bombs, cocktails, med kits and such. I also like the exploration and scavenging in houses with occasional dialogue to help feel engrossing in its world.,,The tone and violence is very dark and I love it immensely. While the fungal/zombie outbreak is nothing new in terms of thematic, it is creative. The gore and brutality is definitely far more convincing than the Uncharted games could ever get. Certain scenes like Joel losing Sarah or interrogating the cannibals is very memorable and shocking.,,So why an 8/10? Well the issues I have is something that can take away from the experience that Uncharted games don't: immersion. At least in a Uncharted game, stealth is botched to make gunfights inevitable. For TLOU, that's not the case if you sacrifice immersion for it. When Joel stealth kills enemies, he puts them in a choke hold and the sounds they make (while audibly satisfying) is far too loud for any person hear, yet other enemies around them (sometimes literally a few feet away) cannot hear that. It shatters so much of the grounded realism at points. Another is your own AI partners, who will often run in front of infected and survivors and NOT GET CAUGHT. Especially Clickers WHO HEAR YOUR MOVEMENTS CANNOT HEAR ELLIE OR OTHER PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS is also very shattering. Usually the best course for this is to stealth kill a few, then go in guns blazing to make it a struggle to live. In a game that emphasizes survival and being smart, it trades immersion for skill rather than keep both intact.,,Another issue is certain level designs are poor. The sniper sequence after Joel, Ellie, Same and Henry leave the quiet town is completely stupid. Seeing no sniper in his nest (let along aiming the gun at you) on top of never being able to kill him by being clever is really stupid. Another is when Ellie has to cover for Joel with a rifle. Considering you have to be very cautious and smart about your resources. it's annoying that infinite enemies spawn whenever I stealth kill them all until Ellie fires her first shot. Killing the gov't troops after Tess sacrifices herself to buy Joel and Ellie time and going into the room triggers no dialogue, but when going upstairs (and following the sequence) there is.,,Another issue is 30fps in this is not a good move. The remastered version fixes this, but the way combat and how the grounded world is really makes pacing through things a bit too slow for me.,,The multiplayer is probably the best if we include Uncharted 2 and 3, but that's not saying much. The meta game it plays is very clever and I like how it ties to the world of the game that Joel and Ellie take place in, but the level up and progression will turn off newcomers more and more as fans and hardcores constantly play and acquire better gear.,,I want to be clear that despite the issues, I still think the game is great and is much better than any Uncharted game (even 4), but the clear place to play the game is it's remastered version on the PS4. The PS3 version (at its time) was impressive, but to call this one of the best games of all time is really being ignorant to the issues it has. Great game, make no mistake, but far from mastercraft work.",normal,ps3,2017-06-27,English,1,0,8,train

artificeprime,"The Last of US raises the bar for cinematic storytelling while also being fun to play and is without question one of the best games on the PS3. Generally, I don't like Zombie games and the concept of this game didn't appeal to me much but it is so masterfully executed that within the first 10 minutes of the game I was already fully immersed. It is the type of game that needs to be experienced.,,Normally games with great stories suffer a bit in the gameplay department but the Last of Us doesn't suffer from that at all. Combat is fluid and satisfying while moving through environments feels natural. Crafting weapons is easy and intuitive. Combat is challenging but it almost always feels fair, at the start of the game I was getting killed regularly but by the end I was smoothly taking down groups of enemies while carefully managing my resources. This type of game usually suffers a bit from being too repetitive but this game does a great job of mixing a wide variety of combat scenarios with stealth and puzzle solving sections. I would have liked to see a bit more climbing and environment traversal like in the Uncharted Games but I can see why they chose not to include that as much because of the more grounded story line in this game. I also would have like the game to be a bit more open but I can totally understand how that would have interfered with the storytelling. Overall the gameplay is excellent.,,While the basic premise of the story isn't anything ground breaking, the story telling is about as good as it gets. The pacing, character interactions and atmosphere are all about as close to perfect as I have seen in any medium. Every moment feels sincere and I can't think of a single false note throughout the entire 20 hour experience. The pacing really deserves to be praised. Most stories of this kind seem to either take place over a weekend or are dragged out to the point of tedium. The story here unfolds over about a year and each arc is marked by the changing of the seasons. It gives each chapter just enough time for the player to really see the progress that the characters are making and realistically see their bonds develop. The seasons also seem to perfectly reflect what is happening at that point in the story. Even in game dialog never felt unnatural which is exceptionally rare. While the story is really an intimate tale I felt it also managed to have some really epic moments without making them feel unbelievable, that is something that I always felt the Uncharted games struggled to pull off well so it really is a great accomplishment for Naughty Dog. My only complaint with the story is that the ideas behind the Zombie plague weren't explored in any depth.,,Characters are the heart of this game and the believable interactions between the characters are on a new level. The characters aren't particularly iconic, there is nothing false about them, they don't rely on any outward qualities to make them memorable and yet despite that they are very memorable. Ellie and Joel embody the idea of being normal people, they could be your neighbors. Yet they have distinct qualities that make them immediately identifiable. Everything they say and do seems to be authentic and who they are within the context of the story. That might seem simple but I find it very rare to see characters who are so consistent and develop so believably.  While Joel and Ellie are clearly the most deeply explored characters the side cast is also excellent and for the most part everyone you meet feels like a real person. I never felt that any of the characters were shoehorned in or fulfilled a generic role.,,In terms of Visual Design, this is the best looking game on the PS3, I have the remastered version of the game as well but even the standard version of the game looked better than a lot of PS4 games. Not only is the graphic fidelity high, the designs themselves are great. Every environment is eye catching while environment are full of little details. Everything feels thought out and crafted with care. Character animations and acting is also some of the best I have seen in a game.,,The Sound Design is also top notch, I wouldn't say that the sound track is the best I have heard but it suits the game very well. The voice acting is all exception, I can't think of any performances that were bad and I can think of many that were great.,,While I wouldn't say that the Last of Us is the best game of all time, I can totally see it being a contender. There is almost nothing that the game does badly. In terms of visuals, storytelling and immersion, this is easily among the best I have seen. For me the biggest deficiencies of the game are the fact that it is very linear and the gameplay is relatively restrictive compared to more open games. Those limitations don't detract much from the experience though. The Last of Us is without question a masterpiece and a phenomenal achievement in game making.,,I give the Last of Us 91%",normal,ps3,2017-06-18,English,0,0,10,train

Every character left a bit of the with me, each of them setting something in my mind and heart. But of course, the two that truly brought this game together were the infamous Joel and Ellie. Incredible work by both Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, bringing two characters to life in a way that not many can. I don't smile much when playing video games unless I do something awesome or if I'm on the mic with friends, but I was grinning from ear to ear whenever Joel and Ellie had their little conversations.,,I absolutely have to give props to Naughty Dog's writing team for the countless hours I'm sure that they put into this game. Character interactions were realistic, amusing, and frequently downright heart-wrenching. They story and characters deserve all the praise in the world for how spectacularly they were handled.,,Now, on to why I think this game isn't for everyone. Personally, I think everybody should play it if they have a PS4, but that's my opinion. The game is a little bit slower, lots of walking/exploring and talking sections, but broken up at very opportune times with bursts of action and tension. If you're looking to play a game with wild, explosive set pieces, than you've come to the wrong place. And yes, many people complain that puzzles consist only of moving ladders, or crates, and they're not wrong; but this game was made to make you feel human, it was made to be as grounded in reality as possible, so please tell me what other sorts of mind-bending puzzles you would find in a modern urban landscape?,,Basically, with this game, I will follow my usual philosophy; judge any sort of media on what it was made to be, not on what you want it to be. Doom is a **** amazing game despite it's lack of story, but that's because it was made for the reason of satisfying our lust for gratuitous violence. The Last of Us is a masterpiece because it was made to draw you in, to show you this ravaged world our protagonists and antagonists have to live in, the sacrifices - both literal and moral - that they have to make to survive, and to protect the ones they love. You're supposed to fall in love with Joel and Ellie, and watch as the love between them grows from an actual distaste of each other to that of family.,,Looking at what The Last of Us is made to be leaves only one real verdict: It's goddamn perfect.",normal,ps3,2017-04-04,English,0,0,10,test

But what makes me appreciate and like The Last of Us more is the pacing and moments the game gives us to let the world sunk in. There are quiet moments, and during this time you could explore to get materials and see what the world's has become. I like this aspect a lot.,,That is really what's amazing about The Last of Us. The way the game allow us to be in this apocalyptic world that is very atmospheric with a good story to follow. It's a back to back thing. You play the action parts and then you watch the scenes.,,There are flaws like others said about the glitch where characters are loud and seen by zombies, yet the zombies does not respond.

silverghost,"All the accolades in the other reviews are perfect. I play this on a PS4, about 2-3 times a year. I never grow tired of the story, of the main characters, even the bad guys. The gory action and foul language would rate it an R in the movies. The graphics are the best I've seen in a video game - bar none. The characters develop and grow during game play, which is itself unique. I don't care for zombies, but this is a twist that got my attention. The 'prequel', called Left Behind is more of a game for girl 'tweens. It was frankly boring to me.,But TLOU Remastered is a masterpiece. I only play single-player games, and the campaign mode is really, really good. It's difficult to say more without creating a spoiler. There are about 7% of the reviews that are negative. I cannot imagine how one could give this a negative review. I didn't read any of them - I don't care. Perhaps if you are considering buying the game, you could read a few and get an idea. I've played video games since Nintendo days, and this is the best I've played. Period.",normal,ps3,2017-02-16,English,0,0,10,test
NiaK2021,"Developed by Naughty Dog and released for PS3 in 2013, “The Last of Us” is a survival horror game where players trek across the United States 20 years after a zombie-like epidemic wipes out millions. The dazzling graphics and exciting game play has earned the game high reviews and 240 Game of the Year awards.,,Joel (voiced by Troy Baker) is a smuggler who is carried with the task of transporting a teenage girl born into the epidemic named Ellie (Ashley Johnson) to a rebel group known as the Fireflies. Ellie is immune to the Cordyceps fungus, a mutant fungus that turns humans into cannibalistic monsters, and the Fireflies believe that her immunity can lead to a cure. They travel across post-apocalyptic U.S., fighting the horrific “infected” and other rival survivors. Along the way, the duo met new allies and enemies, and discover more about the fungus and what it can do. Joel and Ellie, both who have experienced great loss, form a close father-daughter like relationship.,,Players control Joel from the third person perspective for most of the game. Shotguns, knives, rifles, and bows are some of the weapons that can be used throughout. Melee weapons like pipes, bricks and baseball bats can also be used to distract or stun enemies. Workbenches allow you to craft Molotov cocktails, health packs, or upgrade current weapons. “The Last of Us” also offers a stealth mode so players can quietly sneak past enemies or attack them unnoticed. Online multiplayer is available for up to eight people.,,“The Last of Us” had an absolutely stunning artistic design. The destroyed cities have been overtaken by nature, which creates a beautiful contrast of half-standing skyscrapers and luscious vines and flowers. The Infected, especially the Clickers and Bloaters, were truly terrifying and grotesque. Every character was detailed in personality, background, and appearance. The voice actors made their characters sound genuine and made the player feel every emotion they conveyed. The transitions from cutscenes to actual gameplay were never sloppy or rushed. “Last of Us” makes gamers feel as if they are watching a film rather than a game with its realistic, unique plot.,,The rating of “The Last of Us” is a question of concern for some players. Rated M, the game contains graphic violence and gore, strong language, and some adult themes. There are blood splatters, intense screams of pain, and lost of limbs during combat. Death scenes that include decapitation, executions, suicide, and being burned alive may be too unsettling. Strong language is used throughout the game, along with some adult references. “The Last of Us” is definitely suitable for people over 16. Parents of players under 16 may want to watch their child play if they are worried about the content.,,Overall, “The Last of Us” is one of the best PS3 games of all time. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of action, survival and horror games. The entire game was unique and creatively made with its complex storyline and graphic design. “The Last of Us” costs around 20 dollars on Gamestop for PS4 and 10 dollars for PS3.,,Rating,5 out of 5 stars",normal,ps3,2017-02-13,English,0,0,10,train

Zum einen spielt Stealth eine übergeordnete Rolle wobei immer wieder bombastisch inszenierte aktiongeladene Stellen für Abwechslung sorgen. Es herrscht eigentlich permanenter Ressourcenmangel so ist Mirkomangament ein Muss für den Erfolg. Eigentlich ein Musterbeispiel für ein Survival-Horror (Third-Person Shooter) Spiel.,,Warum dann so verhältnismäßig wenig Punkte?! Nun... die Story kann so gut sein wie sie will. Für mich war sie stets vorhersehbar... auch die Charaktere und deren, nach typisch amerikanischem Klischee gestalteten Rollen, habe ich schon zigmal gesehen (wenn auch selten einige Ausbrüche aus diesen feststellbar waren).,,Auch hat mir die Steuerung leider immer wieder einen Strich durch die Rechnung gemacht (vorallem in besagten Aktionszenen). Hier war sie definitiv zu indirekt und mit unzureichendem Waffenfeedback.,,Was mir aber am meisten auf den Senkel ging, waren die permanenten CTD bzw.

Advance, move, kill this one, force yourself to move to the next point and repeat. I don't know, can't find the epicness others did. Once you catch the idea and mechanics, no enemy is a challenge. The story is good thou. And the visuals, like any Naughty Dog game, go further than you can imagine in a PS3: but don't fool yourself, the cutscenes aren't real-time graphics, they use the same engine yes but are pre-recorded, thats why you think they look so great. Another bad thing is the AI, the enemie's one is good, but not the companions. And they will be ignored. When they first showed trailers years ago, it really looked like you had to take care of your fragile companion, or that this companion would actually help you when you had a problem.

gta3lcpd,"Olé sh*t! Mushroom zombies! Ruun dammit ruun! I mean, seriously, this is one of the scariest games I've ever played. And not just that, but probably one of the very best ever! The story and characters are just awesome, f*cking brilliant! And the graphics and attention to detail in the post-apocalyptic world is beautiful. The relationship between Joel and Ellie is awesome, and fun to watch as it changes over time, from the start to the end. Plus the fact that the game has some seriously scary enemies, like the freakin' Clickers! Or those damn, big boy Bloaters (who loosely resemble that big **** on YouTube, Francis). As for the overall gameplay, it honestly becomes kind of repetitive over time. Not to say it's not fun. It really is, but each mission seems the same- crush this guy's skull, set some zombies on fire, sneak around here, shoot em' up over there. But, y'know, they make repetitive a good thing. It's oddly satisfying doing the same things over and over. Like GTA V. Kill some cops, blow up some cars, go to the strip club. Just alike in that way! So, with that being said, I can safely say that this is probably the best horror game I've ever had the fortune of playing, although, I must admit, I have mixed feelings about the ending.

I played the last of us on grounded mode  which gave off a similar atmosphere to that of the resident evil series. The game took about 16 hours to complete but was a total waste of time. I was unable to connect with the characters. The plot of the story was far too plain. Get chased by zombies (infected) or get  chased by bandits.  The story is really just about you running away. People who believe this game is good is only saying that because they wasted their money and wanted this game to be good so they kept telling themselves that it was.

mixxalot,"After playing this game further for more time, I still like it but the gun play mechanics really suck! Uncharted and other games have far better gun play mechanics. It takes 20 shots to down a clicker and aiming guns really is a pain in the ass. IF I had spent $60 for the game, then it would get a much lower score because of the frustrating crappy game controls. Also, shivs break after once use and it is hard to find materials to craft these which you need a lot of to make progress in the game. Graphics and animation are decent for PS3. Also, one thing I wish the game had was a more open atmosphere to backtrack and explore. It is too linear and you cannot backtrack to places you were in earlier to find things you missed. Uncharted has this problem as well. I wish they had better open system like the Assassins Creed and Fallout 3 which let you wander the area to find things you missed. Plus Ellie is annoying a very stupid NPC kid that I wanted to beat the crap out of for being such an idiot. Tess is annoying as well and when she got whacked it was a relief to be rid of her. Another thing that bugged me on the game were how useless the NPC characters are. When dozens of Clickers and Runners bum rush you the NPC stand around useless.

slf2013,"The thing that makes TLOU so incredible is, yes, partly due to its graphics, game mechanics, and incredible AI, but primarily that the game didn't rely on big explosions, first person shooting, zombies, and mediocre gameplay, but instead heavily relied on the storytelling to carry the gameplay. And with an incredible story, you need good game mechanics, graphics, and incredible AI, or else everything will be unbalanced and would be uneven.

Mexican_Jesus,"The Last of Us is a wonderful game by the excellent developer Naughty Dog, Along with it's excellent presentation and Wonderful design, The Last of Us brings a well-told story, with few new things things to offer.,The Last of Us has gameplay that isn't incredibly unique, as it borrow from Naughty Dog's  own Uncharted series and refines the aiming mechanics to better suit the slower pacing of the game. The Sections with Joel and Ellie, are reminiscent of Uncharted 2's ""Mountaineering"" and ""Heart of Ice"" chapters with Tibetan villager Tenzin, and truthfully, I never felt these mechanics were as effective at telling a story as they were in Uncharted 2, which is likely a result of their abundant use throughout the roughly 15 Hour campaign. Story wise The Last of Us is fairly basic. It tells a somewhat standard Zombie Apocalypse story with many twists and turns along the way. However this is greatly redeemed through excellent Motion Capture work, stellar voice acting, and small, simple conversations between Joel and Ellie that can be initiated by the player during gameplay, rather than a standard cutscene. The soundtrack is understated with prevalent use of stringed instruments, which effectively brings the mood to tense moments of the game, and has ties to Joel's past, which is a nice touch. Overall The Last of Us is not a perfect game, but it's a damn good attempt.",normal,ps3,2016-04-05,English,0,0,10,train

Hellion,"Played Last of Us and completed last year. Had plenty of time to reflect on the game. It's got a very interesting and exciting world where the story of the infected takes place. A great enemy and environments are really well done. The characters however are very cliche and one sided. Human villains are especially idiotic. Naughty Dog cannot write great characters. Gameplay is what you would expect for this genre. Third person, hiding behind cover, rinse and repeat. Broken stealth. It's worth a play through at least once but needed more grit, more fleshed out characters, better gameplay and more involvement of the actual virus/enemies. Especially bosses. That reminds me. The only memorable section was the school gym where you fight an armored infected. The world is really interesting which is what kept me playing so hopefully we will get a more fully realized sequel. The DLC is far better and in a way genius playing as a younger person in the world of Last of Us. They should have made that the main game.

aristotle61,"The story and drama are clearly the big draw in this game. It undoubtedly accounts for the overwhelming majority of perfect and near perfect scores. I can understand scores being that high for this aspect of the game, but the problem with this is that it makes a mockery of any kind of integrity in rating the game when this is the basis for your overall score of the game as a whole. This game is NOT perfect, and it is NOT near perfect. So why are the scores?,,The actual game play and combat are ordinary at best. This is a significant part of the game, but apparently little or no deductions are made for this. The mediocre to average combat and game play means the game also has little to no replay value. I think most people would also agree that there are significant lulls in this game where things can get a little boring or tedious. Fortunately, the beginning and ending are great, and they are the two most important areas to get right if you are unable to maintain a high level throughout the whole game. So I guess a lot of people are willing to overlook some of the parts in between. Another lesser criticism would be that the game is a little too dreary even for a game with that type of subject matter. Level design is also far from perfect.,,What happens when another game comes along and equals the drama and story of ""The Last of Us"", but also has great combat and game play? Does it get a score of 120 out of a hundred, or a 12 out of 10? It is a good game and deserves a good overall score, but a score in the mid to high eighties is a very good score and this game really should not be any higher than that. If you come to this game after seeing all of these extremely high scores and listening to all of the hype, you may be especially disappointed. My actual score would be an 8.5 but this system does not allow for that so I gave it an 8.",normal,ps3,2016-03-15,English,3,0,8,train

The Last of Us utilizes stealth, which functions well, but the AI isn't the best, which takes a little bit away from it. The aspect that really makes me frown upon the game is the amount of time dedicated to carrying ladders and shoving around crates to climb over obstacles. A third of the damn game was spent lugging around heavy objects so Joel could continue on finding more crates to shove, more repetitive combat, or another boring cutscene. Naughty Dog did, however, hit the atmosphere right on the head, and come up with a fairly good story, although it's nothing revolutionary.

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic USA, where a fungus has turned people into horrendous creatures called The Infected. You play as Joel, a bitter drug dealer. After saving the leader of the rebel group The Fireflies, Joel is forced to escort Ellie, a 14-year old teenager, to The Fireflies´s safe house. At first, Joel doesn't want to ""babysit"" Ellie, but soon they create a friendship. The road to the safe house is dangerous. Joel and Ellie will encounter bandits, police forces and of course, The Infected. There are four types of stages and infected:,,Runners (the first stage) - Infected humans who is very fast.,Stalkers (the second stage) - A creature with the speed of a runner and the deadliness of a Clicker.,Clickers (the third stage) - A strong creature blinded by the fungus on its head, but hears sound really good and are extremely deadly. If you get caught by them, you die instantly.,Bloaters (the fourth and final stage) - An extremely strong creature which can absorb damage very well. If you get caught by them, you die instantly.,,This game is focused around stealth, so you can, for most of the time, kill your enemies silently by strangle them. The melee combat is very brutal. Joel will slam people against the wall, punch them in the stomach and face and stomp them. He can also throw bricks and glass bottles to stun his enemies. You can shoot your enemies, but I would recommend to do it in emergencies only. Ellie is one of the best AIs I've seen. She yells at Joel to look out when enemies gets nearby and she helps him in melee combat. The Last Of Us´s post-apocalyptic world is a joy too look at. Instead of the traditional wasteland, Naughty Dogs has made destroyed cities with trees growing out of it.

Luka2425,"Wow... this game will leave gamers speechless as well as wanting a sequel.. Quickly! The Last of Us may have the most engaging storyline of any recent games or for that matter any games of all time, because it drags you in and makes you feel like your on the journey along with Joel and Ellie. It makes you filled with emotions, when they have certain emotions and certain parts of the game. Not only is the story epic and beautifully written, but the controls are fluid and the combat is well polished to make this game feel like a true survival horror game. The graphics are stellar, and the sound is top notch as you continue to venture into this deep game and experience bit by bit. Every location in this game is distinct and well designed and each location challenges you into changing your play style. You can be stealthy or you can run and gun, but in the end this game is well polished in every aspect and that is why this may very well be the best PlayStation exclusive.. heck possibly the best PS3 game of all time!

The dialogue is believable, the story riveting, and the visuals and facial animations best in class. The gameplay is also fantastic. You can tackle enemies in many different ways; you can charge in with a flamethrower (awesome) or carefully plan and stealthfully take out enemies one by one from the shadows (awesomer).

kiubier,"The best gaming can currently offer, and it will the best for many games to come. It has set a new standard as far as story telling goes, and as you play it you develop a real sense of emotion and attachment towards the characters in the game. There's zero throwaway characters and zero dull moments in the story. As far as the gameplay goes it's a perfect survival game, you can decide whether you'll go in gun blazing, or of course the safer and more popular choice, be stealthy. Take down your targets slowly and manage to progress to the next stage. Combat in this game is absolutely incredible, and in my opinion is one of the absolutely BEST combat in recent video games. Every time you throw a punch you feel it go through your body with the amazing sound effects. Enemies will pull you off tables, you'll be dodging and weaving as you slam them in the wall, or throw them on the ground and stomp them, all without the use of the much hated QTE. I mentioned amazing sound effects and they really bring this game on another level. The clickers sound incredible, making you shudder every time you hear them, punches really sound like punches and guns are also done perfectly. Besides combat there's also crafting, which you will find extremely useful, crafting nail bombs, smoke bombs, molotovs, health kits and upgrading your weapon with the items you find scattered on the ground. You can either go a linear path or lock pick hidden areas, and be able to overpower your enemies that way. As you get forward in the story the game gives you a sense of progression with new guns you'll get, and also allows you to play as Ellie at a few points, which is absolutely amazing, as you figure out that's she's not just a damsel in distress but rather a strong girl who fights for herself and for anyone near to her hearth (in this case you.), and you develop an even bigger sense of attachment to her. As for Joel the opening sequence is enough for you to understand what he went through at the start of the apocalypse, and why he is who he is in the story. There's zero gaps in the story, as even the reason why people got infected is explained through a fungus that grows in insects in real life. No matter how hard I looked, I simply couldn't find a thing wrong with this game. The only thing that gets close to being bad is the ladders, but since they add a great sense of gameplay and progression i surely can't take away a point for that, so this game is a 10/10. It's perfect.",normal,ps3,2015-07-09,English,0,0,10,train

Hybr1dH3r0,"To all the people that claim ""The Last Of Us"" is not at all worth the time to play or that it didn't ""live up to the hype"", take a breather. You clearly went into playing this game with the wrong mindset. You played the game for the sake of playing it, i.e. to finish it and put it on your shelf filed under ""Games I Played For The Sake Of Playing"". That was a mistake.,,To those that went through the game and enjoyed it and rated the game so highly did so purely because they didn't race through the game. We took the time to indulge in the developer's penchant for creating a story not only worth telling, but for the player to experience. A world worth taking your time in. Characters worth listening to. If you played this game only to finish it and to not bother with again because you felt compelled to see what the hype was all about, then you could very well knock a few points off the score and berate the game's flaws (yes, I love the game but even I know the flaws are woefully apparent). But play through, I mean - experience -  it again and you'll see this is a game far beyond a cover shooter or stealth game or a game reliant on choice. Having said that, the gamers that have compared this game to Telltale's masterpiece ""The Walking Dead"" shouldn't be so hasty. That is the most inaccurate comparison. The two games differ not only in tone, but characters, too. As well as narrative and setting. And comparing the Infected to Zombies? Please. Check the facts beforehand.,,To say ""The Last Of Us"" transcends its medium is a bit of a push. But this is a great game. From the shocking intro (whine all you want about the pace, the game was designed that way) to the climactic ending and all that happens in-between is a testament to when developers care about a game, great results can be achieved.,,This is Naughty Dog's finest game yet.",normal,ps3,2015-06-30,English,1,1,10,train

The game really has the post apocalyptic feel to with the way you have to scrounge for supplies and your given so few supplies that it's really about getting through parts with the few supplies you have and making them count.

EHansen14,"A dark but beautiful world, The Last of Us delivers in a way few games can. In this review I'll be giving my opinions and ratings on the following: Gameplay, Story, Sound, Graphics, and Last Impressions. This will be summed up into a final score.,,Gameplay: 10/10,- You play most of the game as Joel, an aged man more than capable of holding his own in the many life threatening scenarios he finds himself in. The combat is violent, brutal, and heavy hitting. Fist to fist looks and plays excellent, with a weight to every punch. Tactics must be changed depending on if you're dealing with human enemies, or the infected.  Stealth mechanics are very well done, and in many cases it's entirely up to you whether you fight or sneak your way through a group of enemies. There is a large amount of crafting possibilities and upgradable weapons that can be made with salvage found throughout the world.,,Story: 10/10,- This game tells a wonderful story. You really feel like you're watching an excellent movie throughout the entirety of this 15+ hour tale. The game does an excellent job of making you care about the characters you meet.  The story gets more intense as you go, and finishes on a high note, with a thrilling end.,,Sound: 10/10,- Some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game is done by this cast of characters. They tell a story and in the tone of their voice, you really can feel their pain. The game features and excellent and memorable soundtrack.,,Graphics: 10/10,- TLOU is a beautiful game. The world looks stunning and the game runs at a hiccup free 30fps on PS3 (60fps on PS4). Characters look real, and show expression depending on their moods or if they're in danger... or pain. Infected look terrible, in a wonderful way. The game features a wonderful mix of dark, horrifying areas and beautiful, uplifting areas.,,Last Impressions:,- If you've taken the time to read this review, you can most likely already tell that I think very highly of this game. The Last of Us is one of the best games I've ever played and tells what I think is one of the best stories ever told in a video game. Combined with excellent and exciting gameplay. The Last of Us is a must play for any PS owners and in my opinion, is one of the best games of all time.,,Final Score: 10/10",normal,ps3,2015-06-03,English,0,0,10,train

Yobagera,"This is one of the better games I played on my PS3. I completed it an hour ago for the first time.  I took a few weekends to I guess I have played 14-15 hours. I completed it on normal.  The story and the graphics are as good as Uncharted 3. In fact I really like the conventional and realistic story of The Last of Us. I like that the “Zombies” don’t take over the game. You encounter few and when you do they are difficult to kill. The idea of going full blast or take enemies out quietly is great. The game clearly encourages tactical moves. I love that you have to conserve you ammo and only fire where it counts and when it counts.  There are of course negatives.,,What I don’t like is some of the unrealistic features such as carrying a bunch of weapons. Why are not just a rifle, pistol and axe/knife enough? I also want more rounds to my pistol (realistically of course) and not a bunch of rounds divided over a range of weapons. I also want more power in the weapons. There are upgrades during the game but still and when the game you weapons are still not entirely upgraded.  When I put a .45 in the head of a Zombie I want it to go down.,I also don’t like those big unrealistic zombies which fire some kind of gas bombs. I don’t understand why these were included.  Most of the maps feel just too enclosed. It feels like you walk from “room to room” even when you are outside. It does not have to be an “open world” but there are so many games out there which are able to create “massiveness” when needed.  I think Uncharted 3 did it well.,I think The Last of Us is a great game because of the story. It is a PS3 classic.",normal,ps3,2015-05-23,English,0,0,9,train
jjcc97,"I had no problem playing through this game from start to finish.  However, the only reason the game was enjoyable was for its story.  The relationship of Joel and Ellie and the struggles they faced throughout the game were awesome to watch and it felt like a movie.  Sadly, the gameplay did not transition as well.  The controls felt clunky, and the game had no survival feeling to it.  The stealth sections were poorly done and were easily the worst part of the game.  While the combat had some strategy to it, I felt no need to craft anything other than shivs and med-kits.  The gameplay was just average and nothing more.  Due to its boring and repetitive gameplay, the multiplayer was a borefest as well.  And if you do not have a team to play with, do not play this game.  It is nearly impossible to play.

ToatzMcGoatz,"The Last Of Us definitely deserves the praise it has been showered with.  Yes, it is the typical zombie apocalypse setting; and yes, the survival horror game play is not exactly new; but these points are missing what the game sets out to do. It sets out to be an immersive experience attempting to craft characters you want to care about. From the very beginning, the game succeeds in getting you emotionally invested. When Joel's daughter dies right in the beginning, you feel it right along with him and the feeling of loss never leaves through the game. It only intensifies as the game progresses and leaves you to question what both Joel's and Ellie's existence means to each other and because of that, you see how they both end up relying on each other to heal past emotional wounds. Essentially, their relationship becomes a reflection of Joel's father daughter relationship where Joel cares enough for Ellie to do anything to not lose her just so he doesn't have to lose his (figurative) daughter again.,,The beauty of the this idea lies in the ending. All throughout the game, the theme of kill or be killed is hammered in. There is no true defining sense of what's morally right and all throughout the game all of your actions are justified: Ellie is the hope for civilization because she is immune. !!(Spoilers)!! But When Joel finds out Ellie will die from further research into her immunity, he endeavors to save her because he can't stand to lose his daughter again, despite the fact that her death may lead to the cure for humankind. This act of saving a life, usually a noble act, is turned into the biggest atrocity in the game. Bigger than the hunters who kill people for supplies and bigger than the clan of cannibals. Joel's selfish act may very well have sealed societies fate and thereby makes him the biggest monster the game has to offer. By growing with Joel you can understand his pains and why he did it. Ellie saved his life and he may feel he owes her that; but despite this, you have to feel disgusted and question whether his ultimate choice was right. Certainly these themes are not new; but  regardless of that, they are presented extremely well.,,The acting, the cut scenes and dialogue all are masterfully done. While the overall story and events sometimes can be predictable, this doesn't detract from the quality of how its told. Overall, the game play is tense because the balance of items and ammunition is perfect. I never felt I was in a situation where I was screwed on resources nor a situation where I had an abundance of resources. Because of this, I needed to plan on how to approach enemies just to survive without being screwing myself over. While the fighting was fun, a few non-fighting components got overused quickly. The palette ferry system for Ellie (she can't swim) got annoying after the second time it had to be done; there seemed to be no lack of conveniently placed portable ladders; and movable dumpsters for that matter. In addition to those tiresome mechanics, the maps, while beautiful and fun to explore, are entirely linear.,,Overall, The Last Of Us is a clear example what a game is defined as now: interactive cinema. I'm not talking about quick time events; I'm talking about engrossing narrative cutscenes and a smart story intertwined with fantastic game play. This succeeds in both and sets the bar high for what a real game should contain.",normal,ps3,2015-03-19,English,0,0,10,test

Just the characters and how well acted they are is already a worthy 5! But that's just the characters,how 'bout the story you ask? It's the final icing to the cake on this one! It's the one thing that gives this game all the praise from  the CRITICS and the FANS! Oh and the gameplay , gameplay is so amazing , may yet be the BEST 3RD-PERSON SHOOTER EVER MADE . So with all that said,the game,of course also has atleast a bit of faults. In this case,the only fault of this game is it's ending . And it ended up giving me the ""MEH"" kind of feeling in top tier games like this. If that really was the ending of this game,then I HOPE that ""The Last of Us 2"" will just be as a MASTERPIECE as this one! Don't fail the sequel! Oh DEAR GOD PLEASE!,,But will all that said,this game deserves the highest rating I could possibly give. A 10/10,No Doubt,XBOX Fanboys and girls,just try not to wage war on us (Sony Fans) because we praise this game. It's just because it's that amazing and its that of a MASTERPIECE!

Nch90,"For starters, this game is OK, but not good enough to justify a 60 usd buy.,,Ellie is greatly made and lively, but the rest, specially Joel, are pretty bland and predictable. The plot has it's ups and downs, more downs to me than ups. The script forces the player to make only one decision (like when you have to pass the hunter's barracade on chapter six, I tried to pass stealthly, and there was NO WAY to pass it, if I didn't kill every hunter, just because a cutscene needed to be triggered, or the ending itself), making the game pretty narrow. Also, the story tries so hard to slap you in the face that has realistic characters and plotline, and falls short with some Deux ex machina, like when Joel JUST HAPPENED to wake up to rescue Ellie, being kidnapped by the hunters.,Also, i felt the story and storywriter was laughing at me when the last part of the game starts. The investigations tend to ""support"" the desitions of the fireflys to, litteraly, disect Ellie's brain to produce a ""cure"", killing her on the process saying that no samples could last (that's a first insult to the intelect of the player), yet also investigations allegate that scientists couldn't recreate a monkey specimen to produce that inmunology, so they didn't know what where they doing, so basicly they are killing the ONLY SHOT they have to save humanity to make something they don't know if it is going to work (because, SCIENCE!), just to trigger Joel to kill everyone, despite he wanted to dump Ellie 3 times and just bounded on the last part, letting you understand that He sees Ellie like a new daughter (was SO notorious to me that was a plot resource, that not only felt insulted again, but too bland and obvious, letting me see that this game was completly artificial, crushing one of the selling points of the game). That last part, literally, ruined most of the game for me, letting a sour taste, and a ""avant garde"" ending that felt more like a final insult.,Despite that, there are moments that are really great, on the notes and the sidestories you could only read (the notes of Ish are not only really eerie, but really lively),The gameplay is, really, pretty standard, but overall well made. The shooting mechanics feels ok, and most of the time the game feels that you are in control. Yet, I have my complains, like stealth mechanics, as I said before, feel broken. Sometimes almost made it too easy, feeling like a gost to some clickers, and then other times, like on the graveyard, felt that those clickers triggered over nothing.,The crafting and upgrade system is well made. Nothing too revolutionary, but well implemented.,There are a lot of one-hit deaths, specially with clickers. I never stop feeling that they where just cheap deaths to make the game longer, and not a difficulty issue. Also other enemies are just braindead (despite of some literally being braindead), making this game being easy, with some peaks in certain parts of the game, which most of those parts, you don't have alternative to kill it, what a surprise.,Also, this game really likes you to move stuff to transport Ellie to point A to B, making a this an escort game, but is not as annoying as other games are, but not defintly on the level of Alex from HL2.,The graphics are great... for a PS3. Being a PC gamer, this game wasn't exactly eye candy, but the design, and some details and enviorments, are goregous, and in fact too gourgous that is easy to get lost.,The level desing was hit and miss. The game tries too hard to make you feel that you are in a wide world, that is full of life, but is plaged with unreasonable walls, and felt really narrow. Also, sometimes it wasn't clear what you are capable to go or where you have to go, and in the end, the game only wants you to kill everyone on place.,,Despite of some details, this game is not really bad, despite I almost spent writing on the negative side, but not really a ""BEST GAME OF ALL TIME"" for me. May be I was too hyped and overshoot my spectations, and made me really dissappointed that some details are so well made, and the most part are just average, and even bad sometimes.,,I really think this game will be dated in a couple of years, like happened wit Perfect dark, Chrono Cross and some more.",normal,ps3,2014-12-23,English,1,1,5,train

The combat could have used some tweaking, as the guns are completely useless and I would have liked an option to not use melee weapons and save them on other specific enemies as apposed to whoever comes close enough for me to use it. As for the multi-player, avoid it at all costs. It's just tacked on and was added as a selling point rather then being something fun to play. The story was predictable and I didn't really care for any of the characters except for Joel. Yes, I know that the developers didn't want anyone to like him, but he's the only person who made sense to me in the game.,,All in all, I don't think the game is deserving of any of the awards it got and it hasn't earned it's place on my shelf. 6/10.",normal,ps3,2014-11-24,English,2,1,6,train

I don't honestly understand the tongue bathing this game got with its hype, it's overrated to the point of being a joke.,,The main leads Joel and Ellie are both unlikable and flat as characters, they're boorish, lacking personality other than pretty much a single defining feature (Grizzled macho douche for Joel and angsty teen for Ellie) and it changes very little. Every support character may as well have a sign stapled to their forehead saying ""I will die or turn evil"", and I'm pretty sure the enemy AI isn't allowed to dress itself in the mornings, very easily manipulated or spazzy.,,The combat is duller than a bucket of beige paint at a paint drying convention. The ""stealth"" mechanics are poor at best, sneaking up on enemies is pointless and once you get seen, there is no way to break line of sight so they have to search for you, they just instantly know where you are no matter how you try and hide to recoup. The weapon mechanics are nothing to write home about, it's an over the shoulder shooter no different than Resident Evil 4, Gears of War or Mass Effect 2 & 3. I found the controls a bit sluggish as well, and the crafting system, though appropriate for the game type, was okay but not great.,,The story was so predictable that I predicted every single major plot point BEFORE it happened. It tries to hide the fact that it's basically a zombie game by not labelling the zombie-like enemies zombies and the 'clickers' are frustrating at best, if you have more than one coming at you (or coming at you from behind), you're boned.,,The only thing I can recommend is the graphics, better than the Uncharted series, but without a good story or characters, this game is not something I could recommend.",normal,ps3,2014-11-23,English,19,5,3,train

You play as Joel in a post apocalyptic universe. And you task is to escort a girl named Ellie trough the US and find the fireflies. For me the overall story is one of naughty dog worst stories. And i have played all three uncharted games and jak and daxter games and some Crash Bandicoot. The story is bad, the characters development is however one of the few good points in this game. The game play is solid and the atmosphere is good. But what makes this games so bad for me was 1) it did not feel like a survival game , you had always enough ammo if you simply searched around, and it definitely did not feel like a horror game, The genre is action-adventure survival horror , and while i in some  extent agree with survival i dont agree with horror. The game is very short , took me not more then 12 hrs to complete if not less, and you have actually no point  to play it through more then once certainly not more then twice.  So for me the cons was replay-abilities and that it didnt live up to my expectations perhaps is was because  that the genre it was meant to be, and Joel somehow reminds me of Nathan Drake. The game play didnt do somethings new and the ai was pretty predictable is most cases , so i fell i can max give it a 7.2",normal,ps3,2014-10-09,English,3,2,9,train

IBeDonkeyKong,"The Last of Us is a game that many people claim to be one of the greatest games in history based almost solely on a singular aspect of it -- its story. When you get down to it though, even the story is nothing that we haven't seen before, and does nothing to drastically change the landscape of future games. In other words, despite being a good and enjoyable game, it is not a ""masterpiece."" 10 years down the road, when people really take the time to think about what this game did for the video game industry, they will realize that it is not as glorious or revolutionary as the often-times polarized user reviews would say. Sure, it had a good story with some brilliant voice acting. Sure it had decent combat mechanics and great visuals. But did it do anything that we haven't seen before? Sadly, it did not. We've seen great voice performances in video games before. We've seen post apocalyptic survival (dare I say, ""zombie"") games with good stories before. We've seen great graphics before. Despite its good characteristics, this game did not provide any experience that made it dominate the other great games of the generation.,,With all that being said, I am not trying to ""bash"" or ""hate"" on this game. Rather, I am trying to give a realistic representation of the experience that any casual, hardcore, or average gamer who has not played this game before can expect. Do not go into this game thinking that it will change your life - it won't. You will, however enjoy it for what it's worth.",normal,ps3,2014-09-13,English,1,1,6,train

JAGUAR10,"I don't understand the low scores some people have given to this game at all.  IMO it is one of the best, if not THE best game I've ever played.  I was so caught up in the story that I cried more than once.  Yeah, some of the puzzle type things are repetitive - like finding pallets - but the story, the characters, the environments and the fighting more than make up for it - besides you don't have a lot to work with after 20 years of a violent plague almost wiping out mankind.  I liked finding ammo and things to craft with and, for me anyway, I found the sneaking and fighting very challenging on the Normal setting.  I'm an avid 60 year old gamer and I'm not out to prove I can beat the game on super hard mode, I don't try for all the trophies and I'm not a trolling fan boy - I enjoy a good game with a great story and this game has it!!!  In spades!!   I'm on my 3rd go round and cannot stop playing it.  The characters and the things they go through are so realistic.  The voice acting is phenomenal and the other sounds in the environment are extremely realistic.  The infected enemies are scary as **** and the human enemies are sometimes worse!   It was very satisfying whacking the crap out of them with a melee weapon.   I found the controls pretty easy once you got used to them.  I did have to die a few times in some places but I always managed to figure out different strategies for killing all enemies and getting all loot.,This game kept me interested all the way through and more - not like the disappointing Watch Dogs where I was bored to death after a few chapters - The Last of US is definitely worth your money and I can't wait for the upcoming movie I heard about.  Joel and Ellie get my vote for the best voiced and best written characters in any video game ever made!!",normal,ps3,2014-08-23,English,1,0,10,train
stako,"This is THE most overrated I have ever played. But read on - I'm not a mindless hater. The game is good, It's just not as good as everyone is leading you to believe.,So The Last of Us is a game from Naughty Dog, and as such - it comes with some privileges, like better understanding of PlayStation Tech and a pretty huge budget. This guarantees it won't be a bad game, and it's not. But let me tell you why it isn't the masterpiece everyone has been leading all of us to believe it is.,Graphically, it's a pretty game. A lot of people go out of their way to tell us how beautiful it is. And sure, some scenes do look awesome, some views are indeed, as Ellie points out at least 50 times during the game, pretty good, but it isn't the best looking PS3 game, nor the best that Naughty Dog have delivered. If you disagree, go back and play Uncharted 3 again - better design, better texture quality. It is pretty obvious that this game has been toned down from the PS4 version to be released on PS3.,The sound and voicework are pretty awesome, as most games from this dev delivered thus far. Some soundtrack choices are peculiar, but haunting and moving none the less.,However, the writing of the game is noticeably worse than what we've come to expect from Naughty Dog. Particularly, Ellie's part is written terribly, giving the actress no actual words to work with. And the overall plot has huge issues, mainly the fact that the game is not about anything. It isn't about Joel and Ellie and their relationship, it's not about a journey, it's not even about saving human kind - it's just a game with nothing to say. It's a empty, fun vessel and nothing more. The Director missed too many of opportunities to make this experience special or noteworthy. The most interesting part of The Last of Us are the Infected, though the game isn't much about them either. / SPOILERS / And the ending is too disappointing to even be considered a proper ending. Without giving too much away, it practically makes the whole game entirely pointless. Most games end with the player saving the world, or someone special. The world - obvious choice, it makes everyone feel at least a bit happy with their experience. However, this game forces you to make the other choice and save someone special. However, the game didn't give me not one reason to really care and like neither Joel or Ellie, and even if you like them - the thing is that the game does not make you feel for Ellie as Joel feels for her, and that is where the problems lie, in my opinion. / END SPOILERS /,Gameplay is probably the strongest point of The Last of Us, however there are a few issues with pacing here and there, along with a few really awkward decisions that lead nowhere. Even at that, both stealth sections and gunfights are intense, well-thought out and balanced - probably the best we've seen from Naughty Dog.,And that is pretty much it. It's a weak ""The Walking Dead"" spinoff, that is not that great. It's not a ""masterpiece"" - a 100%, a 10/10 or a 5/5. A game considered a masterpiece must have meaning, better writing, and not only good looks, but good design too. To me, everyone who gives this game above an 8 is either dumb or has been paid to do so. If you don't agree on my points - go play The Walking Dead Season 1, there you can see how much better executed is a very similar plot.,Most people have heard probably of BioShock Infinite - a game that was not so overhyped. I'm bringing it up, because it's a good example to compare The Last of Us with - about writing, about how the game is directed to make you care and about the fact that it contains meaning, it contains something that will haunt you until you die. This is something The Last of Us strives to achieve, but I believe that ultimately it's bad directing and a weak plot that bring it down from greatness.,The Last of Us is indeed the most overrated game I have ever seen and played. However, that does not mean it's not a good game - it is. It's fun, very fun in fact, and I do recommend it, because there is something to it. It's just not the masterpiece everyone is now almost taught to say it is.",normal,ps3,2014-08-23,English,0,0,7,train

grenadehh,"Unfortunately someone on here has to write a real review so here you go, you're welcome.,,The Last of Us won over 200 GOTY awards. Don't forget that fact, no Sony fan will ever let you. Does that make it a good game? Absolutely not.,,As has come to be expected from Naughty Dog, The Last of Us excels in presentation. Truly, the art, overall graphics, animation, even the voice acting are phenomenal. You won't find better than them in any other title. Beyond Two Souls is on par, but not better, when it comes to presentation. The dialogue seems legit and it is often times entertaining.,,Unfortunately after you get over that, The Last of Us is nothing more than a meme-stuffed stroll through the drudgery of not only video game cliches, but also the rest of popular media. Comparisons have been made to Cormac McCarthy and the similarity is only cosmetic if you examine the Road and TLOU side by side. Comparisons can be made to The Book of Eli, I Am Legend, and literally every other zombie movie that has ever been made - because that's what this is, an emulation of the zombie genre, but not a parody.,,The gameplay in The Last of Us is absolutely mind numbing. Whether it's the lack of variety or the overall redundancy of every single segment save the very first 20 minutes of the game, there is absolutely nothing entertaining about it. As the game progresses you are simply playing a movie and the only way to progress it is to get from cutscene to cutscene. Once you realize this, you'll also come to the realization that just like Uncharted, the Last of Us is an overrated blockbuster whose merits come from technical accomplishment - and not from actual gameplay, which should be the defining characteristic of a video game.,,Ignoring the plot holes involving Ellie and Joel, the gameplay changes once  you switch characters, but only for about 20 minutes, and not in any way that should be remotely unfamiliar to survival horror enthusiasts. After that, the gameplay changes again from a somewhat stealth driven survival game into a flat out murder simulator, just like Uncharted, and it sheds all former pretense of being interesting, ending in one ridiculous shootout sequence that would give Uncharted 3 a run for its money.,,The only saving grace to the gameplay  is the multitude of multiplayer modes. Essentially it is just team deathmatch, but the survivalist aspects of the game and the moderate realism have been worked in to make it truly interesting while at the same time hilarious. I've never played another game where someone beating me to death with a plank of wood was so hilarious - whether because it's stupidly overpowered or a riot to watch.",normal,ps3,2014-08-15,English,2,2,7,train

BADMANBIFF,"Ah finally a game that simulates/plays a survival horror/adventuresque post-apocaly.....wait....this has been done before....but not quite as good looking, The Last of Us is essentially a lovechild of Resi 4/ Uncharted/Metal Gear/The Road and I AM LEGEND....Sounds great on paper but just doesn't give you the big hype reaction you were hoping especially on it's PS4 Revival, Humanity has been hit hard by the Cordyceps Fungus infecting Human hosts and turning them into the usual BS of some sort of infected man eating fungus zombie hybrid, in comes Joel... A tragedy and years of survival against the infected have made Joel into Battle Hardened Bear Grylls minus the camera crew, fortunately Joel is very likeable an despite his cold Solid Snake killing skills he is a pretty good guy... he almost takes as much damage as wolverine in this story which is crazy....until you meet certain enemies... see the games enemies are Humans who are armed like gears of war characters, Infected Humans who haven't turned fully but still have a serious killer instinct and Metal Gear Extreme difficulty vision which is really irritating especially when the Stealth sections start, also we have Clickers and Bloaters... Clickers are humans that have been overtaken by the Fungus and do not have any sight but instead rely on hearing you creep around seriously any movement and your screwed and especially in tight spots the enemies can come in all varieties and quickly over power you causing a brutal and cheap death, the infected humans barrage you like flies on poo and then sometimes the clickers do instant kills seriously it gets old very quickly and even if your not moving sometimes the clickers just kill you anyway it's like hey screw it I cant see you but I'm gonna eat you anyway! Then we have the Bloaters.... Best way to describe them is like the Tank Zombies in left for dead except these guys take tons of damage before they die and can see you any way and throw these like fungus bombs at you alerting all other enemies in the vicinity! However you only see a couple throughout the whole campaign so that can be forgiven, in comes Ellie, she is basically a rip off of Ellen Page.. but she's ok an only a couple of times does she become a liability, she has a ridiculous boss battle where the boss does one hit kills which really drove me nuts! Apart from the skanky cheap deaths the game is stunning on PS3 and really has pushed the machine to the limits, the Graphics are slick and virtually flawless however some of the cut scenes are in game engine or sometimes CGI... and trigger some obscene loading times and even saving can take upto a minute....the music is awesome and the voice acting great some really nice pieces have been written in and the story is okish... sometimes the controls just don't do what you want them to do and sometimes drops you into....you guessed it an instant death! which sucks I nearly smashed my pad playing this but apart from overpowered enemies, ok chase scenes and some stupid encounters the game is pretty enjoyable the story kept me going and I really wanted to stick with Joel and Ellie and watch them succeed and their relationship grow, now throw in the PS4.... Yesus... the PS4 version has been given 60 FPS and 1080p resolution... Whoopy doo I don't care every game developer says the same crap these days 1080 bla bla our game is crap but it's in 1080p while the game does have a bit more detail than it's PS3 it's not worth shelling out for a PS4 and the updated ""Remastered"" game... did a game that's barely a year old really need to be Remastered? Answer.... no not really, ok so you get loads of multiplayer crap and the Left Behind DLC but if you have already bought for PS3 don't rebuy, I personally enjoyed Uncharted 2 + 3 more but if you want a great story it's worth maybe getting hold of the PS3 version but if PS4 is your only choice then go for that.",normal,ps3,2014-08-13,English,1,1,7,train

mrnice,"I felt restricted by the banality of the puzzles and the sections where the 'run button' is deactivated. The excellence of the art and level design is moderately entertaining, even when Joel is restricted to slowly walk through 10 minute sections. So it takes a non-gamer mindset to appreciate the game, imagining what the world has been like leading up to the state presented, rather than a classic problem-solving approach where you are fully attended to progressing through the game. When Call of Duty shows technical excellence and standard gameplay, I call it an entertaining game. TLoU is similar in its ratio of technical excellence vs gameplay innovation. It's entertaining and a feast for the eyes. But the exciting zombie franchise is still called The Walking Dead, and the exciting Naughty Dog franchise is called Uncharted.,,I leaned towards a 7/10 or even 8/10, but I stopped playing after completing the campaign. No alternative game modes (except online) to play around with. No exciting trophies to attempt. Just a few dozen inconsequential collectibles scattered throughout the campaign, and trophies for completing it several times. In a campaign where so many sections play on the strength of surprise and 'first-sight-marvel' I'd just rather play something else after seeing it once.,,The ending is satisfying, but you could just read a plot summary and then watch the final hour on Youtube and get what the game wanted to tell.

sen0pl,"Don’t get fooled by the over the moon positive reviews. I think this game is overrated. It is a stealth zombie game full of post-apocalyptic clichés. And the stealth mechanic does not work all that well. It is hard remain undetected and if spotted you get exposed to a frustrating head-on fight with enemies attacking from any direction. The levels are big and most of the time there is no clear indication where to go. So you will want to kill all enemies in a cluster and then search for an exit, which makes true stealth game play difficult or even impossible. The game bored me too much. Mid-game I changed the difficulty to easy and forced myself to finish it. I wish I'd skipped this game. Count me out for The Last of Us 2",normal,ps3,2014-07-22,English,1,0,5,train

Except for one thing, gameplay.  Although the last of us includes many good habits and different things to have it turn out to be a great story game, the gunplay in last of was clunky and boring, the hand to hand combat being clumsy and repetitive, and the only thing that really stood out about it gameplay wise was the clickers and bloaters. Being a fan of every game genre, i am really disappointed in naughty dog having to make me say that the last of us would make a better movie than a game, or maybe a walking dead sort of thing. However, if you are in the mood for a good story, then im sure you can get past tlou's incredibly boring gameplay to expirence naughty dogs beautiful yet emotionally brutal outcomes of the story.

epicfuzz45,"I got this game on Christmas and Played it for one night got stuck and never picked it back up until recently, and I regret it. THIS IS THE AMAZING SURVIVAL EXPERIENCE EVERYONE IS FAWNING OVER! It pisses me off even more that Metro Last Light came out this year and yet this piece of instant kill **** is the one that got all the attention. The game relies on the Instant killing clickers for Its difficulty, because those are the only enemy that you cant beat the **** out of. Your resources are always low not because you are constantly using them to fend of your enemies, they're limited because the world is so stupidly empty that you never had them to begin with. their is no tension about resource conservation when you NEVER GET THEM, human enemies almost never drop ammo, (which is just stupid, like I just manage to kill them when they had just used their last bullet) and guns just suck so why even use them, especially when you can LITERALLY BEAT ZOMBIES TO DEATH WITH YOUR BARE HANDS AND WIN. The game is a joke when clickers aren't around and then its only hard because they **** instant kill. Stealth is boring and has no tension because clickers are so damn easy to sneak by, (just move slow and hold still when the start to throw a hissy fit) and any other foe can just be beat to death. for a comparison lets look at Metro Last Light a far superior survival game that gets it right. supplies litter maps if you just know where to look, and the world is so detailed you'll always find new things you have to SCAVENGE and doing so is always rewarding encouraging you to do it more, while the last of us barley ever has **** anywhere, and if it is something it will always be something you don't need, like empty **** bottles. In Metro Last Light the threat comes from the enemies themselves, In the harder modes you can be quickly killed, but if your skilled enough you can avoid it, your not getting killed by a Animation is what I am saying. When you get into combat it requires the use of resources that will deplete the more YOU fail, the game gives you enough to thrive if you have the skill and if YOU **** up then YOU have to pay the price, not just get insta-killed and restart again or just punch the world to death. Metro Last Lights combat is fun, interesting, responsive, and satisfying while the last of Us has generic combat that's hard because its clunky, and I despise clunky controls because you end up fighting them more than the enemy. the stealth is where the last of us wins right? I disagree, while the stealth in Last Light is simplistic, that simplicity honestly makes it unique, whereas The Last Of Us has  stealth that is just like the stealth in pretty much every other stealth game made recently, I MEAN YOU EVEN HAVE DETECTIVE VISION COME ON! But aside from that its also just annoying, there is no satisfaction and it far too often breaks and I get seen through objects or when I shouldn't, Where in Last Light I only get spotted when I made a mistake or when I should encouraging me to try harder at it and look forward to a chance to prove my skill rather than dread the next stealth section. The best way to express my dislike for this game is the simple fact that the only time I had any fun is when nothing was happening and I was constantly dreading when the game would come back. that's not the sign of a good time. Also yes the characters and voice acting are good but Im too annoyed or bored to give a **** The game part of the game has to be bearable for the story to matter and this is honestly one of the worst third person shooter OR stealth games I've played in my life. The best description I could give of this game is if someone took dead space and uncharted taped them together and striped all the aspects that made those games good out only to have a bull come in and **** all over them to fill in the gaps. This game sucks, and I will NEVER understand why people praise this ""game"" like the patron saint. **** this game for wasting my day and **** everyone who would call it superior to Metro Last Light, or Dead Space 3 for that matter, It would be a blasphemy to say that Last Light compares to the Worst of the Dead Space games, let alone overshadow one of the best survival games made.",normal,ps3,2014-07-20,English,19,2,2,train
killerkingnf,"This game accomplishes what many games seek to do but fall short of doing. By far the best looking game on the PS3 I've seen, and I find it difficult to switch back to other games after playing The Last of Us due to the difference in visual quality. On top of that it has a phenomenal story behind it with characters you become attached to. These two qualities alone make you want to keep playing the game until you beat it. Add into these factors that it has great game mechanics and the option to choose how to play. After beating the game you have the option of multiplayer, which is tied into the story mode and has unique gameplay settings that I haven't personally seen combined into one game before, or since. All of these things add up to make the best game on the PlayStation console, and one of the best games ever as well.

Kilgukalts,"Played it as my first ever PS3 game and had to note that if you aren't mastering the controller to the level that your basal ganglia takes partly over the conscious cortex functions, the game is near impossible in certain situations. The story is not typical hollywood and has some deeper moments, which is good. However, there are several logical fallacies -most importantly it sounds that the writer had no input from someone with medical/molecular biology background making for instance the vaccine subtheme unreasonable. Sure, many player might not notice these problems. Regarding the story and gameplay would have wanted less linearity and more choices. Ah yes, and the followers (e.g. Ellie if playing as Joel) often gave too many hints IMHO.

Yes, its not like Metal Gear or Deus Ex, but that's because it's not supposed to be.,,The Last Of Us has a simple, yet effective story with beautiful and immerse levels. You play as Joel.

DrRedMustacho,"The Last Of Us is a game brought you by Naughty Dog, they gave us the Uncharted franchise and Jak and Daxter. But will this game be great as many people expected? Was the hype worth it? Maybe, some people call it a ""masterpiece"" others call it ""The Best Game of All Time"". This game starts out really interesting, you start to play as Sarah, daughter of Joel (the protagonist). The zombie apocalypse starts and Sarah dies. 20 years later you need to escort a girl (Ellie) across the United States Wasteland. The first thing I noticed, the voice acting was flawless and graphics looked beautiful. But my hype was over in  5 minutes because all you do in the game is walk, accompanied by some back-story, I'm not a big fan of Walk-and-Hear in videogames. But this was awful. There was no zombies in the game (they appear every 3 hours in the game).

Not only do you immerse yourself in a world that is frightening and beautiful at the same time full of nasty creatures, but you also emotionally connect with the fictional characters that venture through the zombie infested land. When I finished this game I was actually sad because I did not want it to end. The game is set so you have the opportunities to make your way through the obstacles your way, that's what makes it so great. You can choose to kill the zombies in some levels or simply stealthy move past them, you choose. And then their is constant surprises every where you go for items to collect which can change the course of the game, if you kill a zombie or hostile sometimes you can pick up guns,ammo,bombs and more. I enjoyed every part of this game, and some levels were so hard I had to try multiple times to make it through ( bloater in the gym just die already ,).

EzioA88,"Naughty Dog has proven time and time again that they can deliver great gameplay with amazing storytelling. Crash Bandicoot was a childhood dream. The Uncharteds evolved so much that they are now classed as some of the greatest games ever made (Number 2 was excellent). But where do you go from there? What can you do with a new IP? Well, you take the lessons learnt from your previous series and just improve. Better gunplay, better story, less linearity. That is The Last Of Us. The greatest video game of this generation and one of the greatest games of all time.,,Key to its success- the story. The relationships developed between the characters. This is one of the most realistic games out. Right from the start you have the feeling that this is something completely different. For the first 5 minutes you take control of Joel's little girl, a vulnerable child who gives you a bleak outlook on the world, as she observes the horrible events unfolding. When you switch to Joel things are worse, as his daughter becomes even more of a liability. But no matter what the next few minutes will destroy your heart. I cried like I have never before in a game. As Joel hugs his daughter and begs for her life back... These first few minutes are what made this game for me.,,Fast forward twenty years and we are now in a bleak and oppressive future, where Joel only cares about himself. He has nobody to look out for. And then Ellie comes along, a girl he starts off disliking, but slowly warms to. Three quarters through the game and he tortures a man to find her. The ending proves how far he will really go. Ellie possesses the key to the cure for the virus that has spread throughout the world and only her brain can save us. But Joel won't let her die and  the final level is the greatest part of the whole experience. And the ending is phenomenal, as Joel proves that not only is he willing to become a monster, but he is also willing to lie to Ellie so that she stays safe. Like an episode of Game of Thrones, there are no happy endings. I did just spoil the whole game, so anyone who read this for a recommendation I am sorry- I did warn you!,,While the gameplay could never outmatch the brilliance of the narrative, it is still finely tuned and highly polished. Joel is just an ordinary man and he controls as such. He vaults and runs and his movements are realistic to the point that you believe you are playing a movie. The animation work is unmatched by anything- even next gen games like InFamous: Second Son! The hand to hand combat is brutal and unflinching. You'll crush heads and tear up bodies. The gunplay is even nastier. While some won't like it, Joel isn't some elite army officer and he aims like a normal human. There are a lot of weapons to gather throughout the game, ranging from a rifle, to a shotgun, to a bow and arrow and each one handles differently and realistically. They all have some pretty nasty animations, with the gore being turned up to a large amount. While this may contrast to the touching story moments, it shows how visceral and unflinching the people in this world are. There is brutal violence, but there will also be touching moments, such as talking to Ellie about ice cream trucks or telling her about Joel's daughter.,,There are also looting and crafting elements and upgrading your weapons and Joel is rewarding and gives you a good feeling. You can also craft traps and explosives and medkits... The systems aren't complicated, but there is enough substance to offer you plenty of do. There are also numerous collectibles (many worth getting) along with unlockables. With this amount to do, you will want to replay the game and I did! New Game Plus is available and there are many difficulty modes to try your hand at. But don't worry because the enemies are challenging.,,Most of the time you will be fighting humans and while there are various types of normal people (and every type can be brutally ripped to shreds), the infected foes are the best to fight. They offer a challenge and there are four types to take on. The standard runners go down easy (unless they surround you), but the Clickers are he deadliest. Get too close and they can insta kill you. The Stalkers are like nastier, faster Runners and the Bloaters are the worst around, with brutal moves and deadly long range attacks. Every fight requires careful thinking and a good strategy if you want to stay alive!,,The Last of Us also includes a multiplayer mode and unsurprisingly, it doesn't take over single player as desired option. However, it is a smart, faster paced place to spend your time and the modes are very different to what you would expect. It's polished, has multiple maps, plenty of unlockables and still offers a pretty fun time.,,I better wrap this up, so here goes: The Last Of Us is a beautiful game, with amazing graphics, excellent sound work and striking innovation.

The only thing that kept me going was the fairly interesting story, and the high production values. This is a Naughty Dog game, so you can expect superb graphics, animations, voice acting, and cutscenes. However the gameplay is a mess. This is a 3rd person shooter with some tacked on stealth. However ammo is scarce, so most of the time it is better to go the stealth route. The controls however feel loose (read: realism), and require you to have better aim than your standard third person shooter. NPC enemies also have very spastic animations, so even when you think you have a shot on them, they will jerk their body or head to the side and you will miss the shot. You go into an annoying stagger animation when you get shot (again, realism), which requires you to re-aim your shot, by which time the enemy has already closed the distance and is pounding you to shreds. Close quarters combat is stacked towards the enemy, especially the zombies, many of whom can one-shot kill you at this range. Ellie, your NPC companion, aids very little in combat. Enemies are also oblivious to her presence, even though it is clear they can see her. I guess the idea here was not to punish the player for enemies spotting your NPC companion, but this simply breaks immersion. You also can't switch weapons while on the move, which is especially aggravating when you need to switch from an empty to a loaded weapon while an enemy is chasing you. The game itself plays like your typical cinematic linear shooter, with some outdoor areas that open up a bit and allowing you to explore. All your standard shooter gameplay tropes are here: ""defend an area from hordes of enemies"", ""find an alternate route"", ""clear area of enemies to proceed"", ""run away from an armored vehicle""... you get the idea. There are some tiresome ladder and plank ""puzzles"" that require you to move a ladder from A to B to get somewhere. They add nothing to the gameplay and feel like padding. There is also a skill system (what game doesn't have this nowadays?) that allows you to upgrade your character. It's good to have, and allows you to tailor your gameplay experience somewhat, although I found many of the skills to be useless (faster crafting? what's the point? You shouldn't be crafting during combat). The story is serviceable. You play as Joel, a grieving father tasked with delivering Ellie, a  girl immune to the zombie virus, to the human resistance movement. It's like the Walking Dead; the last vestiges of humanity fighting against zombies, lots of interpersonal relationship stuff, harrowing situations, etc. Which is fine, not a lot of games go this route. But TLOU didn't invent this genre, so let's not give it more credit than it deserves. Joel is your typical gruff white guy we've seen dozens of times by now. As for Ellie, they seemed to have cast someone too old to play her, as she comes off as being a little too precocious. The section where you play as Ellie. She says ""piece of sh*t"" or ""motherf*cker"" EVERY TIME she kills someone. Why was this necessary? It's not behavior you'd expect from a pre-teen. The much talked about ending, though clever emotionally, left an empty feeling with me, similar to Prince of Persia 2008's ending. As a player, I want to feel like I accomplished something. Don't throw away everything I've done in the past 10+ hours.,,To sum up, this is not a fun game. If you want to play a Walking Dead episode, with all of Naughty Dog's trademark high production values, then this is for you. However if like me, you like your games to be fun, then give this a pass.",normal,ps3,2014-06-15,English,4,3,6,train

With an interesting and intense story with scenes that kept me at the edge of my seat grinding my teeth I can say that not many games have had this effect. When watching cutscenes or playing the game I was always on my toes eager to know how the next event would play out. Furthermore, the game's fluid third person game-play worked well. Naughtydog has stepped up their game from the Uncharted series with significant improvements to how well the came plays and how precisely I can control my character. The characters are likable and interesting, the graphics are very good, there is not much to complain about other that the decent multiplayer, which is still fun.

Of course adding to the fact that Ellie adds to the characters adventures really sets the bar for games like this, blowing bioshock infinite and other great games like GTA V out of the water (Depending on your taste between a good survival story adventure and a violent story).

The graphics are ok, but that does not compensate the lack of liberty in the controls, some of the weapons are useless, like the molotov bombs, and it is very hard to find a good weapon, and that's a shame in a game that needs to have action and combat. This is NOT a survival horror game, maybe an average survival game, like I am alive.

TheBrokenGamer,"The Last of Us,PlayStation 3,,This review is based on my experience and does not intend to insult other reviewers opinions.,,Story – From the opening scenes to the final moments of the game and that black screen hits your eyes you find yourself hooked on the story that Naughty dog shovel into your face. You fall in love with the relationships and the characters, the story itself you believe to be quite simple, a virus outbreak and survival, what some people don’t realise is that underneath the main story the sub stories are the ones that hook your mind and your heart. The fight for survival, the feel of loss in every direction, the sense of helplessness that shadows the main character even though he has been hardened by the world around him, the beauty of life that we all take for granted but seen through a girls eyes, the list is endless, words cannot describe the story, the story has to be seen and felt.,,Graphics –  The graphics are beautiful, the textures of the shirt on our main characters back to the beautiful yet disturbing settings around them all add up to a beautiful display of artwork and creativity. Realism and at some points you find yourself stood still and turning the camera around to view sections around you in awe.,,Characters – The characters are the best part about this title, it is very difficult to describe them especially in just 5000 characters or less. Ellie and Joel bring something to your experience I personally have never experienced within a game before, in fact by the end of the game I found myself wanting a daughter for my first child, the chemistry between the two characters is heartfelt and breath-taking, you find yourself truly caring for them, their journey truly does become yours, from the silence and annoyance felt between the two at the beginning to the love and protection you get by the end. The characters whom they meet along the way also add that extra bit of excitement and heartbreak, one of my personal favourites is Bill, the character of few words and such a big story that if missed leaves him misunderstood. The depths within the game itself are mesmerising.,,Result – This game is a life changing moment of art, the character development, the story, the action, the music… everything hooks you from the get go and once you start you have to finish it, you find yourself craving more and you miss the company of Ellie and Joel within other games. May sound over the top but if you find yourself one who appreciates the little details (Keep an eye out in the toy shop when one of the brothers you encounter picks up a toy and is told he can’t have it, watch Ellie closely and then quickly take the camera off her and back on her again and you will see a hidden gem that shows how cute they have made the character) you will truly love this game.,,Of course there are certain things within the game that can make you scream for the hills, the AI can be very annoying at times, Ellie can seem to stand in front of enemies within a single bit of reaction from them and when you are sneaking through Clicker territory and Bill is romper stomping around the place it does tend to knock the illusion but if able put that aside and enjoy the ride.",normal,ps3,2014-06-03,English,1,0,10,train
IEerocity,"Definitely one of my favorite single-player game of the 7th generation. The story is amazing to say the least, it isn't that generic nor is it REALLY original but it is executed very well. Gameplay is pretty much what you'll expect in third-person shooters with abilities to upgrade your weapons with gears, upgrade your character with pills and scavenging. My only problem with the game overall is immersion. Your companions aren't really ""in the world"" with you as they cannot be noticed by enemies even if they walk right smack in front of them, they still won't alarm the enemies so that kinda takes a little bit of immersion out of the game but it doesn't warrant a point deduction.

However, there is also very little to set this game apart from numerous other story and character driven zombie scenarios of the last few years (or few decades really, they aren't new).  It's solid, pretty, has good mechanics, and good characters.  However, the fact that all of that is shoved into yet another post-apocalyptic rubble pile stifles everything good about it in the intense humdrum of ""been-there, done-that"" that permeates most ""mature"" modern games.  I'm tired of zombies.  I'm tired of nuclear Armageddon.  I'm tired of shooters and shooter hybrids set in yet another dystopia.

Fancypenguin,"First off I have to start this review by saying that I am in no way a fanboy.  I owned all 3 consoles last gen and I plan on doing it again in the next generation as well.  Second off, I have to say that this is going to be more of  a rant than a real review. The Last of Us shines in its narrative, characters, and atmosphere. The story and characters are some of the best in any game I've ever played, and the way it is presented is second to none.  The characters all have distinct personalities and are well developed.  The dialogue is great and so are the voice actors that deliver it.  The atmosphere really does feel like a post apocalyptic future.  The graphics are some of the best ever (on consoles) even though the color pallet looks like the game ate Fallout 3 then spit it out and added vines everywhere.  With all this having been said, I have zero idea how anybody can think this game is a masterpiece or anywhere close.  The gameplay (you know the point of playing a video game) is so lackluster, and the game is not well designed.  The game tries to be a stealth-action survival horror game except it meets none of those genre's criteria well.   It would have been great had the areas flowed together coherently but anywhere that there are enemies is basically an arena of conveniently placed boxes (much like another stealth-action game it tries so hard but fails to be, Metal Gear Solid) And really Naughty Dog? With the oil tankers full of money that Sony gave you to make this game, you couldn't spring for more than one stealth choking animation or 5 skins of enemy characters?  It fails on the survival horror front because you are always being presented with bullets and medpacks and whatever you need because the game was made for casuals.  The crafting makes no sense as Rag+Alcohol apparently = bandage.  The ""puzzles"" consist of moving a latter from one place to another. Thrilling.  By far the worst part of the game is the AI.  All the AI in the game is broken.  Enemy AI is completely inept on even the highest difficulty and your partner AI?  God help me.  Having bad enemy AI is enough to break any stealth game, but bad partner AI too? Might as well kill yourself.  If you want to play a third person survival horror zombie game with bad partner AI and stiff controls then play Resident evil 4, a far superior game. The game is very shallow and repetitive, the infected lack variety with only 4 types to fight against.  The gameplay itself is slightly above average, yet the game has garnered 9's and 10's on almost every major site, presumably based on story alone.  Well I'm sorry but the fact is that I will never give a video game a 9 or a 10 based on story alone.  What even qualifies as a game anymore?  If I rendered Terminator 2 in video game cutscenes and let you press a button every 10 minutes to  choose what one liner Arnold says would that be a 10/10 flawless masterpiece of a game?  I'm not saying that this is what the last of us is like, but its not far off.  Everything is so linear and all the exciting things happen in cutscenes that happen every 5 minutes. If I wanted to play a mediocre stealth game in between watching a decent zombie movie, I would watch Shaun of the Dead and pause every ten minutes to play Alpha Protocol.  Since when has it been ok for a VIDEO GAME to be called a masterpiece when the gameplay is average at best? You'd would think that with the way video game technology has progressed that developers would give us bigger worlds to explore with better AI and more depth, but nope, they're using it to make games like movies.  This brings me to my next point which is, in a video game this story is amazing, but as a movie, this story is average and cliche at best.  There are other games that have good stories that aren't a boring chore to play through and that actually add something to the respective genre that they're in.  The last of us is by no means a bad game, but it is only a slightly above average game that brings nothing new or interesting to the Stealth action or Survival horror genres, and is made very good by its story and characters (even if they all swear like they just got off the USS Saratoga)",normal,ps3,2014-05-27,English,1,1,7,test

Zyrondargo,"The Last of us is a good game, but it isn't great. The hype for this game is just way too much. For the purpose of a fair review I will state all aspects of the game and objectively give my opinion on it.,,1. GRAPHICS- AAA ps3 only game made by naughty dog. Graphics should be superb, and they are, nuff said.,,2. SOUND- the music of the last of us does what it's supposed too, it makes you feel what you need to feel at just the perfect moments nothing felt out of place and some tracks did stand out. I personally love how it has this western like guitar thing going on and some orchestral ensembles here and there, I implore you as a gamer to just listen to the soundtrack by itself because it is good. (Favorite songs are the Last of us, All Gone, Vanishing Grace, and The Smugglers). Voice acting is very good, props to Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker though, they deserve their awards.,,3. STORY- This is where things get pretty rocky for me. I hate the whole zombie survival craze happening right now and I'm tired of it. At least other games do something else with it or at least try. The last of us on the other hand just went and pretty much took the formula from the walking dead. If you take out the mushroom infection angle, some of the little details, and slapped on a walking dead title on it people wouldn't care or even be able to tell the difference. Also the people, what's with everyone being **** in post-apocalyptia? Is that what the last of us means? The last of us nice or kind of tolerable people. I know the angle of man up to survive or good people get left in the dirt but that's just not how humans or human society works people. I hate this formula. Look at fallout or metro, people have variety, people should be interesting not just guys you shoot at. The formula is even more predictable when you realize that there are no good or nice people in this world because they either die or are **** pretending to be good then they die. The relationship of Joel and Ellie is the main attraction here and their growth as human beings and as partners is emotional and the best part of the game. The ending however, is the worst. The ending felt rushed and the whole situation was just silly. No one should defend it. Moving on.,,4. GAMEPLAY- There are action elements as well as stealth elements and you will rely on stealth more often. The premise here is that the infected rely mostly on hearing than sight, because mushrooms are coming out of their heads and you can use Joel's hearing to kind of echolocate them, unless you unlocked survivor mode which turns off the hearing mode. The infected humans called runners can still see and will charge you, as opposed to the clickers that shamble about slowly until you make a sound by running or throwing an object. I would talk more about the other infected like the bloaters and stalkers, but honestly I didn't notice the 2 stalkers you meet in the entire game and the bloaters that are like tanks and take a lot of damage to kill are few and far between. There are 2 bloaters you are required to fight but other than that it's best to just avoid them. Then there are the people, half of this game you are going to be fighting people, know that. These are the parts that are less interesting for me. It feels like watered down uncharted, sometimes I wish I was playing uncharted instead in these parts, but at least the game keeps up tension by giving you little to no ammo and forces you to sneak around or avoid fights all together. Throughout the whole game you will find manuals, what I think are pills, and salvage to upgrade Joel's stats, upgrade your guns and make the items you need, like bombs, Molotov cocktails, med kits, and shiv's to kill clickers with (cause hand to hand only works with runners and people) and open secret shiv doors with. The crafting and workbench systems are simple and easy to use albeit maybe too simple..hmm. But good enough. The stealth elements though are pretty..ok. I swear uncharted 3 had a more interesting yet just as clunky stealth system. Point is you crouch behind an enemy press a button and that's it, no other way to stealth kill, same animation every time. Also for a survival game, there's not many survival aspects.,,FINAL THOUGHTS,,The game is perfect..in a sense. It's just been done to death before, but it's the best of the done to death lot. It's honestly not breaking the mold like silent hill 2 or RE4 or hell even dead space. My only nitpick is that the AI sees you but not Ellie. It's weird seeing her run around making noise and the people are un phased by it. I would rather that I have to make her hide (like Ashley in re4), that would also make tense situations. Nothing about it is groundbreaking at all, any element was done and done better by games in this generation. It's generic, but perfectly generic. there's nothing that will make you hate it.It won't change your life but it will become the standard of what a polished game should be.Buy it.",normal,ps3,2014-05-21,English,0,0,8,train

DemonicSoul,"Story:,I really enjoyed the story, It had great writing, voice acting, and body language. The game also does a great job at making me care for Joel and Ellie as the story progresses by giving me those slow moments where the two engage in dialogues. 10/10,,Gameplay:,This game can get extremely intense if you play it stealthy. Even though stealth is optional, you're most likely going to be silent since ammo is scarce and the A.I can get really aggressive by charging, flanking, or suppressing you. One immersive braking mechanic is that the A.I won't attack your companions which isn't really annoying because imagine you're trying to sneak around, and Ellie accidently lures a clicker(infected) or bloater(super infected) to your location. I think it's a good idea for Naughty Dog to do this. You also need to explore to find parts needed to upgrade your weapons, supplements to boost your survival skills, and crafting items to build med kits and other useful stuff. 9/10,,Graphics: T.L.O.U contains some of the most gorgeous and detailed graphics I've ever seen on a console. The facial models look realistic, great lighting, excellent sound design, and the backgrounds look beautiful. 10/10,,Multiplayer: The multiplayer is really fun to play, but I do have some issues with it. First, instead of earning XP to level up, you have to gather supplies to help build your clan in order to unlock customization items. What this means is you have to do good in every match you're in in order to get supplies for your clan (you get most of your supplies from kills). This can be really hard when you have a clan of 70 because you're going to need around 70 to 80 supplies to keep your clan alive (which isn't easy). There are also only 2 game types which might limit replay value for some, and the game suffers from balancing issues bow almost being a 1-hit kill, smoke and shiv load outs, bombs, and more). 6/10,,Verdict:,The Last of Us is one of my favorite games of 2013 and one of my favorite PS3 exclusives.

Top score; 7-6 score: great but not one of the best; 5-below score: serious flaws.,===========,As in Uncharted, Naughty Dog proves once again with The Last of Us that a game with repetitive gameplay but emotional story and pretty visuals to hide the nature of the gameplay can fool many and get 10/10s for no reason.",normal,ps3,2014-04-29,English,11,2,6,train

I was hooked from beginning to end. Beat it in one day and definitely worth a $60 experience. It's dark and gritty. Alot of people criticized for a movie and not a game.

A game that genuinely will make you cry and never forget some of the disturbing choices you are forced to make. An ending, that sticks with you and will never let go.

Generic backstory, glitchy gameplay, cliche characters, uninteresting dialog, OK voice acting (except for the girl, which is painfully bad). Heavily developer-planned combat scenes mean you either do it their way or you die.

If you are a COD fanboy, and need action a million times a minute, this game is not for you. Think of it more as a interactive movie. The stealth-action gameplay is also fantastic, but you have to be patient in between the action, and realize this game has tons of character development and story-telling. The graphics are fantastic and the feeling of survival is really great.,,Don't get me wrong, I love all sorts of games of different types including COD, Forza, God of War, etc. This, however, is my favorite game, and is exactly the kind of game I had always wanted to play.

Raghavchugh,"The Last of Us is an incredible journey in the post apocalyptic United States. The game is simply an exemplary narrative of the lives of Joel and Ellie. Naughty Dog does a stellar job of expressing emotions through Artificial Intelligence, great voice acting, and spectacular animation. The characters have been developed to such an extent that they feel real. The little bits and pieces in the game which force you to believe that they exist never fail to amaze me.,,This game is one of a kind, and quite easily my favorite of all time.

TheHonestOne,"Call your self a monkeys uncle and declare the world deceased because I'm not that keen on the Last of Us (back ground screams). Just let me explain.,,Firstly with the title, who do you think us refers to? It isn't humans, there's tons of those. It could be psychopaths because by the end you are the only one least in the entire world BECAUSE YOU KILLED THEM ALL. Yes you would think with a vastly reduced population life would be valued a tad more but no it's cheaper than action figures at Kmart.,,Secondary is the story. Many praise this to be the best written story in video games. And it certainly would be if you wiped out games like spec ops the line, bio shock, half life, dark souls and a whole load of other games from very existence. Yes while it does have a nice intro and is well presented it can be very predictable at times and does have a lot of coincidences like a really important item we though was gone forever just HAPPENED to be in a building we ran into in a chase scene. The characterisation between Ellie and Joel when their TOGETHER is fairly weak, Joel is just really a prick to her at times and Ellie at times really does say stupid things. But the absolute weakest part about it is the side characters. Naughty dog has this terrible habit of dehumanising every character except for the protagonist, at some point someone who has known Ellie all her life just decides to kill her because of reasons. Also the ending might lose you cause it did me.,,The gameplay itself is quite well done, I liked the semi-linear environments with survival elements and highly limited resources for self-defence. However there are two gripping problems with it. One is Ellie herself, she's just there, she doesn't fight often unless scripted and enemies don't attack her, so why is she even here? For story yes but story should inform gameplay not patronise it into doing its bidding. The other problem is the super zombies. There so annoying, I try one attack that would normally clear out an entire army of infected bit it just doesn't effect them for some reason like a school boy bringing out his everything proof shield. I get we're supposed to be careful around them but I didn't expect getting my jugular vein eaten was appropriate punishment. Also the AI can be weird at times but now I'm just not picking.,,All in all the Last of Us is pretty god and you can spend on worse games that came out around that time ride to help cough. But it is pretty over rated. Even the developers think so, the conference after the meeting the co of naughty dog thought that the game was mediocre. Well I hope this will lead them to make a better game in future. But for now go play the much under rated silent hill series.

MentalVortex,"The most overrated ""game"" of all time. The atmosphere and story are decent, but there is very little actual gameplay. You probably won't realize this on your first playthrough because you will be playing overly cautiously and exploring for materials, wondering what is around the next corner. But once you've beaten it, you will understand that there are very few fights with enemies and a whole lot of slow boring sections spent walking around listening to Ellie, separated by lots of cutscenes.

For a good couple of years as a dx11 pc gamer I had once again placed my ps3 at doorstop level (aside from the odd multimedia stream here and there) always ready to catch a glimpse of the next console exclusive. Then The Last of Us was released.,WOW!!!,This game far exceeded every expectation I had for an end of cycle first party sony release and IMO surpassed the fine efforts of valve on HL2 in using computer technology to convey story in a way completely unique to this industry. Every moment you experience is a part of this story and the strongest character is expressed through level design. Subtle cues of audio and visual effects texture art and animation stir emotions in ways the player may have thought to be exclusive to the realm of film production. On top of this excellent singleplayer is a fantastic multiplayer that for me, really evoked a sense of play seemingly forgotten by much of this industry.

KevinA335,"Arguably the greatest game of this generation; The Last Of Us is the culmination of Naughty Dog's very successful journey on the PS3. TLOU is truly a masterpiece of character-driven narrative, stunningly well realized world-building, profoundly believable characters, magnificent OST and voice acting, award-winning dialogue and intelligent systemic game design along with some of the best, well acted cinematics you'll find in this medium. The characters in The Last Of Us (especially Joel and Ellie, not limited to however) are complex, deep, believable, and memorable. As the player you'll find yourself truly caring about them and their journey which is something a lot of video games fall short in achieving. If you're a gamer who cares more about the story and characters in your games than anything else, this is as good as it gets. The one tip I'll give to people who are interested but haven't yet played the game, don't rush. Take your time and explore buildings and areas, you can find notes that are in my opinion worth reading and while exploring different areas you can trigger certain conversations with Ellie (some that happen without you having to press any button and some that you need to press triangle for) that are definitely worth it and add to this one of a kind experience.

Throughout the game, you find yourself being overprotective of the teenage female protagonist, Ellie, and not worrying about your safety as much as hers. I really felt like her dad as I kept a gun out every time she went alone to open a door or pull a lever. Naughty dog has definitely done their job on creating and atmosphere that you fear every door and corner you pass. This is definitely one of the top ten best games ever made. I completely recommend this game to ANYONE. I really feel like I know Joel and Ellie on a personal level, after playing this game. If you haven't played this game, you should be ashamed.

aeglorre,"Put simply, this game - for what it tries to accomplish - is perfect but for one mechanic: the team (and occasionally enemy) AI. These things, however, do not affect gameplay per se, but they do affect your suspense of disbelief, which in a game that tries to redefine ""immersive"", is a huge deal. So let's go through that first:,,When you play as Joel - especially in stealth cases  - Ellie has the propensity to run around in rooms full of enemies, or engage in combat when you clearly just want to hide. Sometimes, in cases where you do EVERYTHING to be as quiet as you can, instead of whispering she speaks up loudly. Fortunately, ND knew this and thus her ""actions"" do not affect gameplay: enemies will not ""see"" her if she runs around when you are hidden, clickers won't hear her loud speaking when you clearly want to be quiet. In other words, she's simply not there as far as the enemies are concerned. The same goes for enemy AI in sneak mode, Joel can sneak up to an enemy, choke him out with him making struggling noises, and another enemy that stands just a couple feet away does not hear what's happening.,,So, these ""AI in sneak mode"" issues clearly do not affect gameplay, but they DO affect your suspense of disbelief. All games do this, no developer has with 100% success come around certain issues with gameplay where everything ""makes sense"". However, it is an elevated issue in TLoU because of its ambitions to be THE definitive immersive gaming experience.,,And honestly, it really, really, really does ace it in that department, save for the aforementioned AI issues. The fighting/shooting mechanics work great, the stealth portions are done well, the level design is amazing, environments are highly diverse and ND really went out to make this a survival game, NOT an action game: Every single bullet, every single arrow and every single brick you find is literally essensiall for your survival. This game brings back mechanics that have long been gone in survival games: scarcity of resources. Not since the original Resident Evil trilogy have games put a snare around the players regarding the resources. And it's never done in a cheap manner either; if you don't have enough bullets there are always other options for you to get through the hurdles.,,The story is actually fairly standard in broad terms but very unique when you look closer. The post-apocalyptic atmosphere is excecuted perfectly, the sense of time elapsing as the pair traveling across the US on their pilgrimage for worldly salvation accurately feels agonizing, long, exhausting and diverse. The sound is amazing, from the small sounds of wind and rivers, to the distant screams of the runners, to the sporradic comments that the characters make throughout. Everything feels alive and is a true feat in the immersive department, no other game as far as I am conscerned nails ""believable environment"" as good as TLoU. It's more like watching a movie than playing a game (not the MGS4 type but the good type). The best feature in the sound department is definitely the music - which is excecuted perfectly (especially in the end scene) and... the voice actors. As far as the character go, they are the definitive cream of the crop; the characters are the single entity of this game that make it as great as it is.,,Ellie and Joel are real. They act as one would think a mourning father that has seen loved ones die for decades would act, or how a 14 year old that grew up in a world of decay and sorrow would act, and their progressive development is so evident and so compelling. You FEEL for Joel and Ellie, you WANT them to do well, it's not YOU playing the game and 2 passive shell-puppets on the screen that you live vicariously through, this game IS about Ellie the 14 year old girl, and Joel the southern lone ranger that's taking care of Ellie. This game has as much character development as the best of TV series, or movies, or books. Granted, that statement might sound somewhat hyperbolic, but if you don't believe me, play the game and see for yourself.,,In closing, Ill just say TLoU is an amazing piece of video game art. Ive played video games for 2 decades and as an avid video gamer I am proud of what ND have achieved here, for my favorite entertainment medium. People have to take into account where gaming as entertainment stands in todays society, and how it compares to mediums like movies/books, to understand the sheer impact of this game, and to how important this game might've proven to be in the future. TLoU broke boundaries and reached audiences that are unprecedented in video gaming. This game will be remembered as a staple in gaming history, and hopefully will lead the gaming medium into the field of being taken as seriously as the most serious of movies, or books. With games like TLoU and Uncharted, ND are definitely carrying the torch for the sake of the entire gaming community, and as far as Im concerned, they are our true leaders.",normal,ps3,2014-03-08,English,0,0,9,test
MFK863,"This will probably go down as one of my favorite games of this console generation (being a close second behind Red Dead Redemption).  From the story to the combat, everything felt fresh and new.  Playing it on survivor mode also added to the intensity with limited supplies.  I can see a lot of FPS people not liking this game but I see that as more so not liking anything that isn't a FPS as opposed to not actually liking the game itself.  The story was actually better than most blockbuster movies you would see these days.  If you liked other Naughty Dog titles like Uncharted then you'll love this game.  However if you don't usually play anything outside of COD and combat is way more important to you than story/visuals then this may not be for you.

Vanpire73,"Finished the game a few months ago and let it simmer for a bit.  Before I dig in, I will let you know I am a 41 year old guy that has been a hardcore gamer for most of my life.  I have played and enjoyed everything from your Marios, Demon's Souls and Civilizations to your Forzas, Maddens, and Call of Duties.  If you can dig that, then dig this- this is a game that does nothing more than take all of this console generation's staple mechanics, systems, and story developing elements and put them together in a highly polished, fantastic looking game.  3 to 5 years ago I would've given this a 9.5.  But in 2014 it is completely generic in almost every respect.  It does have some emotional depth to it, but nothing you haven't seen in 1,500 better movies.  There was a point in the first few hours I thought I was going to have to quit out of sheer boredom.  And when it did pick up, all the ""no, man, it's not Uncharted... the gameplay is better and the story is PHENOMENAL!  It's not just a long cutscene.  You'll see, man.  Trust me."" statements I kept hearing never panned out.  The boredom never really went away... the story never really panned out like I was expecting.  The AI was terrible.  I tried to immerse myself, but then I'd witness Ellie running in place into a clicker  who would then come after me for not sneaking slow enough 30 feet away.  Even though it is their best, I believe Naughty Dog has already gotten too many free passes.  And the gaming crowd has disappointed me with what we'll give 10s to and with the acceptance of faults that should be fixed by now.  All that said, It is a pretty good game.  It would've been great 5 years ago, but not in 2014.  My real rating is 7.5, but I round up.",normal,ps3,2014-03-05,English,0,0,8,train

Canem,"A great game to enjoy once or twice. The story is average when you think about it, not much different than what you've seen before. It's a very linear game and very scripted. For some this is ok, but for me it seemed like you were watching a movie, and at times, it may have been more enjoyable for a cutscene to take the place of a playable gunfight. Further into the game, time and time again a group of scavengers will show looking for you whilst walking back and forth from one end of the room to another before you take them out. It gets a bit frustrating when you finally take out the group only to hear the clicking sound from a group of infected coming your way.,,Good game but a little bit overrated.

Slone,"There are 3 things that really impressed me with this game :,- the music and how it's used,- the acting,- the visual artistic approach,,I could add characters development, although I do feel the success on this part has more to do with the acting than the actual writing. The actors really make this work even when the dialog seems to a bit short on credibility or psychology.,,The story is good, much better than in any game, and is interesting to watch because of the characters. I also found the ending very strong, because of the ambiguous feelings you get from it.,,I'm a big fan of Half Life 2 and the Fallout series. In many ways, TLOU felt like an homage to these while being a sort of graphical upgrade. If Fallout 3 had the same graphics and the same level of voice acting, it would have been the game of the decade.,,Where TLOU is very much lacking is on the gaming part. It's quite dumb and repetitive. No actual puzzle, the challenge is to find the exit of each map and that either involves sneaking past and optionally taking out humans or zombies (or infected, as they call them, like in 28 days later or world war z) and / or getting to the cut-scene that will give you access to the next area. Quite limited.,,Also, there are quite a lot ""dragon's lair"" moments, as I call them. Dragon's lair was an experimental video game which was about watching an interactive cartoon and pressing the joystick button at the right moment. Well, in TLOU, there are many of those inept moments when you're asked to repeatedly press a key so that the cut-scene can go on. Most of the time, there's no challenge, no consequence and it mostly feels like a way to make sure you haven't fallen unsleep while the story goes on. Probably aimed at people with ADHD.,,You can upgrade your characters and your weapons so that the game gets easier, but it doesn't affect the strategy you may use. There are a lot of things that are off like the companions walking on the feet of your enemies while you're sneaking, or the cut-scene showing your characters running away from something when you actually left a pile of body behind you and didn't feel any kind of hurry. Elements like gathering artifacts, pendants, and comics are... well... tedious and no fun at all. But I guess ND wanted to make sure you would explore every part of their gorgeous environments. In the end it doesn't help immersion. It's kind of weird being able to (somehow having to) waste a lot of time searching every corners when you're supposed to be on a mission of some kind. The scavenging part is very badly integrated and feels gratuitous.,,That said, there are very strong moments in that story, even though the narration can feel quite sketchy. The winter part is probably my favorite, despite a rather clumsy narration, it succeeds in bringing intense emotions in its conclusion.,,It's really a casual gamer's game, although a classy one.

Zemeckis,"I am confident to say that The Last of Us is the best game that I have played in this generation. Even though my favorite genre is JRPG, I recognize all the developers’ efforts in this memorable masterpiece.,,First of all, this game is not a shooter. Every year people complain about the same franchises arguing that they do not innovate. Ironically, games like Call of Duty still continue to break sales record over and over. To be honest, I expected that The Last of Us was going to be somewhat Uncharted-like (since it’s from the same studio), but for my surprise it is not. It is all about surviving. You have to make every bullet count instead of shooting frenetically. In my opinion, a game has a good chance of succeeding by not being more from the same saturated shooter industry. Another thing that makes the game brilliant is the stealth system. It completely suits with the survival aspect.,,Secondly, I believe that games are not only about gameplay but also story and soundtrack. The cast is memorable and the voice acting is amazing. It is easy to have immersion in the game because you get involved with the events between Joel and Ellie. They are charismatic and somehow invite you to be part of their adventure. One thing that I have to highlight is the fact that this game is not about zombies. In fact, the term used to describe these kind of enemies is “infected”. No banal things like “shoot only in the head to kill them” exist. People are just infected. It is possible to kill some of them unarmed and not by blowing up their heads. Some levels of infection require weapons to kill enemies, but it is a feature that adds challenge to the game. The concept of infected may not be original, but from I gather it is easy to distinguish the infected ones from this game.,,For these reasons, The Last of Us is my game of the generation. In a world where console games seems to decline year after year with the advent of mobile and casual games, I cheer that hardcore, innovative and memorable games continue to come. Naughty Dog was able to prove that even in the end of generation there is still hope for old school gamers.",normal,ps3,2014-02-22,English,1,1,10,train

The game play is good, for what it is (slow paced, survival gameplay), but taking a time out to look for a ladder, or pausing to use ""listening mode"" while sneaking really took me out of the game, and hurt the immersion. The game's story is also nothing special. Although presented well (fantastic voice acting and narrative, and some of the most beautiful cut scenes I've ever) seen) the story is predictable, and the ending was abrupt. Joel and Ellie though, we're fantastic characters, and there was emotion in latter parts of the game. The aesthetics are amazing. The game has the looks of a next-gen game, is backed by a great soundtrack, and as I said before, is presented EXTREMELY well through cut scenes and voice acting the likes of which could give a dialogue-heavy game like Mass Effect could contend with. All this said, I would give this game a 7/10, but this game has other trick up it's sleeve, offering one of the most enjoyable multiplayers I've ever played. A 4v4 versus match is set up, offering 3 modes. A TDM, a no re-spawn TDM, and a mode called ""Interrogation,"" where you must execute enemies to gain info on their lockbox location, which you then must open. The latter is the most enjoyable mode. It is essentially a refined Uncharted 3 multiplayer, with survival aspects and a two-sided story line. This boosts my review to an 8/10.

If you do play this, do the world a favor and don't rate it because it'd be like a person with no taste buds rating classy cuisine.",normal,ps3,2014-02-18,English,3,1,10,train
flax0174,"As many of you know this a naught dog production, the same developers which produced the stellar uncharted series. It is set in a future post-apolyptic desolate setting of america and is based round a few key and vital characters. The story is about survival and gathering resources for your character to use in crafting aid items, weapon upgrades etc. The game is linear in nature however not that it detracts from its special cinematic sequences or it's beautiful yet eerie setting, plus there is subtle player choice to be had in naughty dog's latest outing say upgrading your weapons, crafting molotovs and first aid items like in rage the video game, very similar. The main aspects of the last of us is its realistic and wonderful graphics, stellar voice acting/animation and the feeling that grips you tight of how close you get to the two main characters in the game. There is certainly a emotional link to them throughout your adventure, and in time it will only grow. the combat system in the game is for the most part very smooth and fluid-like, you can sprint, jog, vault, take cover, sneak etc which all helps to take out your enemies in a stealthy manner or in a brutal, satisfying way. The game does from a story point of view pulls you right in and doesn't let go. It is a mix of survival horror/action adventure with both elements ever so subtle and seamless in their exchange. The aiming in the game is quite bothersome and has a lot of natural sway on the reticle, which can be reduced slightly by finding supplements and herbs to upgrade it with. The level design in the game is top notch, It is very diverse and with that allows you utter freedom to play the game how you want. The story line is very simple but expertly well done. And the ending in my opinion is truly satisfying and well scripted. The attention to detail with the graphics is outstanding, everything is so ironically full of life and colour, the water effects excel with everything i have ever seen. I do however have some minor gripes, but due to being so minor that they do not affect my final score, but there are infrequent graphical bugs, with items disappearing and entire parts of the game as well, but there are seldom seen and only last barely a second. And you can only alter the sensitivity of both analog sticks rather than individually change them. Also the cover mechanic is automated and sometimes you simply cannot stick to a certain wall and on occasion has given my position away. And i do also wish the survival skill system was more abundant in which you had more choice on given gameplay aspects like vaulting and running speed, melee moves, etc. The enemies are fantastic within the game and choose random paths, are quite perceptive and just generally fun to take out. The game has a multiplayer mode which has several modes and about 11 maps, the survival skills, crafting system, weapons, and gameplay mechanics are borrowed from the campaign, which is a good thing. It always for a slow paced and tense experience, certain mechanics are tweaked to allow for a more smoother and balanced play. And is generally a lot of fun, and the one of few multiplayers in which i have enjoyed and dedicated a lot of my time to. But with all the praise, the main reason i love this game is the colourful cast of characters and the emotionally driven storyline. Its a pure gem of a game and one that ill be playing for some years, a masterpiece.",normal,ps3,2014-02-18,English,10,2,10,train

UserScore,"The Last of Us Review:,Pros/ Good Points:,+ It has one of the best stories ever told in videogame history, using not only cutscenes to tell the story, but gameplay as well, with in-game main and side conversations that truly make this game outstand. Incredible character development, with every single character adding something to the story. The best looking game of the generation with unbelievable lighting, colour palette and textures. Strong gameplay with a great and simple crafting system. Top notch audio design. Incredible music by Gustavo Santaolalla which developers used in the most appropriate moment, throughout the whole game. The multiplayer not only fits perfectly with the tone of the singleplayer experience, but also it is a hell of  a fun  to play and the only way you'll get higher levels will be by your skill in the game, and not the equipment you carry. Framerate rarely drops. I only experienced 3 or 4 technical glitches/bugs during my 3+ playthroughs. Though many complain, not letting the enemy AI find or notice Ellie is the best decission in terms of gameplay, though it can be a little game breaker. Ally AI is helpful, unlike most games.,Cons/ Bad Points:,-  Enemy AI can be either too dumb or way to intelligent. Trophy list makes you replay the game at the very least 3 times if you want to get the platinum.,Final thoughts and score:,The Last of Us is the highest user rated game of the generation, and not for nothing. It achieves one of the best linear experiences with a really deep, touching and emotionall story that will stick within your mind weeks after beating it.,Average Score: 10/10",normal,ps3,2014-02-17,English,3,1,10,test

KevinQ5,"Just Amazing, Another Masterpiece by Naughty Dog,The Gameplay gives a nice challenge to the player. What you do is while progressing, find some scattered bullets, guns and objects since it is about survival. The combat can give an awesome atmosphere, and a fight with the small supply that you're given in the game, becoming longer with how much you collect within the game, you can give very brutal attacks to the enemy using melee with bats, axes and wooden planks, giving a satisfying combat, Stealth elements are a good part of the game as everything else, especially with the hearing ability. Exploration is not so much of a Problem, but it becomes better as a puzzle. The only problem is the AI, Enemy AI often seems to ignore a companion and they sometimes glitch a few times.,The Story is the best of many video games, giving emotional and tear jerking moments, and the characters, especially Joel and Ellie, are extremely likeable.,The Multiplayer has great gameplay elements in the game to it's deathmatches, but it's filled with annoying Micro-Transactions, typical Naughty Dog, always giving micro-transactions to a multiplayer.,Overall, even though it has a few problems, This game is a Masterpiece and the best game i have played in the generation.",normal,ps3,2014-02-17,English,2,0,10,train

The gameplay is very boring. All it consists of is running from one place to another by climbing holes in walls or avoiding monsters. There was absolutely nothing rewarding me to keep doing this over and over.

The story is very good. It has 1 boss battle but its a creative one and a little tip in that boss fight throw a bottle or whatever at the third knife try then run up and knife that him like an animal.

DmCarter,"I can't really get enough of this game. I just can't see why people hate this game so much, this is probably the best game I have played in my life so far, it has changed my life and the way I see the world. Most people that play GTAV (for those that prefer GTAV) haven't really grasped the concept of TLOU's story, they haven't grasped the feelings, the hate, the love, and the loyalty that stands between Ellie and Joel. This is a remarkable game, and if you don't have a PS3, I highly recommend that you get this game. This isn't a game where you can roam around and do whatever you want, this is story, and the story is heartbreaking and it keeps you on your couch. Ellie and Joel are really great dynamic protagonists that go through a lot of pain and fear to travel across America. When you play the game, you will see that the relationship between Ellie and Joel we'll start building up to a point where they can trust each other and care for each other. It warms my heart and it's understandable that you have to cooperate with others to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.,,The Last of Us has left a scar on me, that scar will never be forgotten, because it will remind me of that one game in 2013 that changed my life. I really do recommend this game for players that have never even heard of it or have never played it. It's truly a masterpiece, it may not be GOTY for some people, but it's a masterpiece.,,Ellie is by far my favorite character that has impacted my experiences in gaming so far, probably the best female character I know so far. She's just a little 14 year old girl that's born in a QZ for 14 years, eventually she is taken out across the country by a man who has been through a lot of rough times, Joel. Ellie isn't familiar with the outside world and it's lovely to see her talk about things she doesn't know about.

Bstamps,"The Last of Us is the gateway to a whole new era of storytelling and interactive experience. Naughtydog has managed to justify almost all of this game's gritty and intense mechanics through story-telling and the emotional impact of taking a life in order to survive. It doesn't hurt that the actors were all perfectly cast and portrayed. Honestly, much better than most of the movie performances I have seen all year. The Last of Us excels beyond a game and into an experience. I really hope non-gamers can learn to appreciate the impact a perfectly executed game can have and how important it is as a new medium. The Naughtydog studio is visionary and will forever leave me craving more of their style: flawless and impact-full storytelling, some of the best actors and talent in the business, stunning and engrossing graphics, and emotions and thoughts that will last long after you play the game.,,Oh yeah, and the multiplayer experience: Ridiculously amazing. Nothing is better than out-trapping and out-smarting your opponents. It is such a perfectly balanced experience (with the exception of the OP flamethrower) that you can easily pick it up and find immediate enjoyment. Playing in groups of four is an absolute blast and coordinating tactics with your friends to annihilate the opposing faction is beyond rewarding. It's good enough that Naughtydog gave us one of the most emotionally rewarding and mind-blowing single player campaigns available, but the fact that I can keep coming back to the multiplayer experience to nail-board bash my way to success is much appreciated.,,An amazing game. The best game. They better be working on The Laster Of Us because I have never been so satisfied and yet craving of more. If anyone can successfully pull-off a sequel and continue improving a series it's Naughtydog. Considering they made as near of a perfect game as they could... it's interesting to see where they will go to continue to push the gaming industry.,,If you have a PS3 and haven't bought this game: you have a serious problem.,If you have an XBOX 360, you need to sell your system, buy a PS3, and buy this game.",normal,ps3,2014-02-05,English,0,0,10,train

Kappattack,"{Minor Spoilers} As simply as I can put it, The Last of Us is an accomplishment. This is the game to beat in the coming years and the first game I've played that masterfully melds gameplay with narrative in a way that seems effortless done by the masterful team at Naughtydog. This is a game about the best and worst of people that is heightened by the intensity and great use of tension in a post apocalyptic setting. You play as the character of Joel; a person that has been affected very personally by the fungal outbreak and has few morale lines left to cross after surviving for twenty years after everything changed. He lives in a quarantine zone within what's left of Boston and is controlled by the military under martial law. He survives through smuggling things in and out of the city and is eventually tasked by a rebel group he has ties with to smuggle a teenage girl named Ellie to a checkpoint which eventually turns into a journey across the country. The character of Joel is more complex than many protagonists and isn't necessarily meant to be the ""good guy"". He's a person with a past and his own set of morals which makes him very believable. While Joel had a life before the outbreak, Ellie was born into this world and didn't know life outside of the quarantine zone before Joel reluctantly took the job that defines the game. You see the contrast between Joel and Ellie very early on. Ellie doesn't have anything to miss before the outbreak and often asks Joel about things in the environment that served a purpose before the infection spread. Joel will often describe things very vaguely early on almost like he doesn't want to get to close and form a relationship he fears he'll lose. The whole game has moments like these that can be dissected and more eloquently described but I just wanted to put my voice out there for how much I love this game and figured people who haven't played yet might be reminded by all the hype surrounding the next DLC so hopefully this helped someone.",normal,ps3,2014-02-04,English,0,0,10,train

I finished the game 3 months ago and I still mention it in every games conversation. This simply is a must have game. Naughty Dog have pushed the ps3 to its limits to create a beautiful looking game with a fantastic engaging story and unforgettable characters. You really come to care for Ellie (the young girl you are protecting) during the game and this is something so many games cannot do.,,The controls work very well and really give you the feeling you are fighting for your life. The level designs are genius and look stunning. The story is exciting and moving, Once scene had me having to pause the game and just take ten minutes to think to my self as it was so upsetting. The zombies and monsters are terrifying, the clickers really are the things of nightmares. You really do feel like you are in an the middle of a zombie apocalypse, no game has ever felt this real. Once you pick up the pad you will not put it down until you have completed it.,,Oh and the ending! Wow, this game does not give you choices or alternative endings. You play as Joel and you are forced to see life through his eyes, you make his decisions not your own and these some times take you to dark, gritty places. You come out of the game feeling a true emotional response. Even a joy that the world you live in is not like in the game. I found myself happy to kiss my kids goodnight in the safety of my warm home.

mmrventricle,"Naughty Dog proved itself again as the best game studio. Its production, the Last of Us inherits the studio's specialties: solid gameplay, satisfying platformer, interesting dialogues and most importantly, amazing characters. The protagonists, Joel and Ellie, are easily among the best written characters in all video games and you will, after playing this game, feel attached with them and genuinely care about them. I don't know if it is possible to not like Joel and Ellie but I am in love with them.,Set in the post-apocalyptic US, Joel and Ellie must journey across the country in search of a group. In this world an unknown pandemic has ravaged mankind, transforming infected into half-human-half-fungus undead. What sets the Last of Us different from all other zombie games is that the infected here are also blind and therefore by moving quietly it is possible to avoid conflict at all. Ammo and healing supplies are limited (there is no stomping corpses to reveal supplies here), so stealth is always the better option. When combat is the only way to go, the Last of Us becomes a solid third person shooter almost identical to the Uncharted series.,The world in the Last of Us is vibrant and believable. As is all post-apocalyptic worlds, the world goes into chaos and survival is dependent on oneself: only the fittest survives. There is no hero or antagonist in the Last of Us; only survivors. In fact, Joel is so ruthless against other survivors standing in his way that you might feel that he is, in a sense, the villain.,However no game is perfect--not even the Last of Us. Supplies for tools feel a little bit too plentiful. For example nail bombs should have been valuable weapons that are only used in the most desperate times, but they are in fact so common in the world that I found my backpack too full to carry yet even more of them. In the same sense weapons are also too powerful for a game like this: your arsenal isn't limited at all; you will get a freaking flame thrower half way into the story. Also the ending is somewhat disappointing; I won't spoil anything for you, but I was disappointed.,BUT--- with this ending it is possible for them to make a sequel. :DD As the Last of Us is so successful this is very likely to be the case--I cannot wait to see more of Joel and Ellie's journey.",normal,ps3,2014-01-30,English,0,0,10,train

Whilst the most commonplace is downtown cities, the game definitely mixes it up with varied and beautifully detailed areas, which definitely keep the game fresh.,,Throughout the game, Joel and Ellie (a young girl who seems to hold the key to immunity to the disease) develop in ways I personally rarely see in games, with exception to Spec Ops; The Line. Several decisions they make could be questioned on their necessity, and towards the end, Joel becomes something almost barbaric. This character development should be noted, as it begins to blur the line as to who the bad guys REALLY are. At the end of the game, Joel makes probably the most controversial decision in the entire game; killing those that could be considered the saviours of mankind, all to protect Ellie. Whether this move could be considered good or evil is far from difficult, and leaves the player thinking hard, long after the game is over.,,In terms of gameplay, the survival aspects are fantastic, the combat brutal (bullet shots FEEL like bullet shots, each taking a huge impact on the player), and overall, keeps you on the edge at all times. Expect to die a lot, but also to feel satisfied should you make it through. This game is not for the faint of heart, but giving you the option of either stealth or guns blazing is something which can involve a far greater range of audience. Expect, however, to have to perform both, as supplies are scarce, and complete stealth throughout the entire game is expected only of true gaming ninjas. Prepare to put up a fight.,,Overall, the game is fantastic and diverse, with occasional break points, where you are free to just wander around and take in each environment, gathering supplies for further confrontation. Combat is, of course, plentiful, and this game suits those looking for both a good story, and a game that provides decent stealth and survival aspects on the side. Should those meet your needs, buy this game. It's far beyond worth it. I haven't yet touched multiplayer, but in the singleplayer alone, this game is well deserving of a 10/10.,,Naughty Dog have done it again.",normal,ps3,2014-01-19,English,1,1,10,train

Plasmaneedle,The Last of Us has a good story but that's all that's good about it. The stealth mechanics were poorly executed and the fact that you must often kill enemies and their near sightedness renders them obsolete. The overly common checkpoints take away most of the challenge and tension and that mixed with the fact you must often kill enemies to progress makes it feel less like a survival game. The enemy AI is rather bad and the companion AI is never helpful. The plot is cliché and uninteresting and the supporting characters are annoying. There is a few bugs most notably one that deletes your saved game. The multiplayer is low on content with only the standard deathmatch and team deathmatch. Deathmatch can easily turn into hide and seek and team deathmatch is decent but nothing noteworthy. Naughty Dog needs to learn that a game needs more than story.,normal,ps3,2014-01-18,English,54,9,1,train
thegodfigure,"Not for the faint of heart. This is the kind of game that is so dark, gritty and uncompromisingly brutal, that you are probably gonna want to take a shower. I don't know how I didn't play this sooner. The Last of Us features, in my opinion, the most engrossing story in the history of video games. Everything about the game is heart-wrenching. You feel the pain, sadness, and utter despair through every moment.,,The combat is fantastic and is an example for all 3rd person shooters. Fantastic mechanics, good cover system, and endless possibilities in terms of taking on enemies. The gameplay feels so natural, it is often panic-inducing.,,As if the story isn't worth the price tag, the multiplayer is endlessly entertaining. Unlike run-of-the-mill multiplayer experiences (COD for example), this requires teamwork and smart use of resources. It can be a little overwhelming at first. It has a pretty steep learning curve, but after getting acquainted with the single player, it becomes second nature. I tend to burnout on games after 10 hours or so, but The Last of Us is an exception.,,Graphics are A+.

It's enjoyable, has a fantastic storyline, and is packed full of emotion and grit.,The ingame relationship between Joel and Ellie is well made, and shows how they fight for survival against the frightning zombies.While the game does offer some new groundbreaking features, it can get a little bit repetitive.,,The enemies are really well made. Everything from the bandits to the zombies look and feel real. During the Clicker scenes, you can't help feeling scared while you're crawling along the floor with clicking in your ear. The game is very emotional, and all the cutscenes are amazing.,,But this game does have some cons. As mentioned by some people, enemies do not react to your team mates (Ellie for example). Especially with Bill, he runs like a bloody elephant, and nothing detects him. But if you screw up one tiny bit, the Clickers'll get you. Also, the shooting mechanics are a bit frustrating. To veteran PS3 players, it's a walk in the park, but me (who is new to consoles), it is difficult aiming a pistol.,,(Kudos to the people who designed, animated and created the Clickers. Those are some funky as enemies, and one of the greatest zombie types of all time.),,Regarding crafting, what can I say? You scavenge parts and use them to craft items, upgrade your weapons and make Joel be able to shoot faster etc. There is a lot of loot lying around, and you can't be too picky in this time of apocalypse...,,All I can say is, get this game.

MikeRoss,"The last of us is a game which has been surrounded by a lot of hype and during the first few hours of gameplay you would be forgiven for being a little disappointed. The level design is linear and claustrophobic, the controls are cumbersome and the puzzles are simplistic to say the least.,The limited ammunition theme (though it feels artificial most of the time - e.g. happening to always keep you around 7 or 8 pistol rounds whether you use them or not) as well as the crafting mechanic serve to up the tension though. Unfortunately, this tension is relieved somewhat when one of your companions bumps into an enemy and they don't react. It seems that only the player is visible when sneaking in the last of us and that's a cop out that really hurts this game.,,You'll spend as much time hiding as shooting as you evade the decent enemy AI which will seek to flank you when given the opportunity. That being said, the tiny environments limit the AI's tactics as much as they limit the player. Though they get slightly bigger as the game progresses, they never feel open and the game can feel like it's on rails. Even on hard difficulty the game gives you hints of what to do next every 30 seconds and the ""listen"" mechanic means that enemies will be unable to sneak up on you or hide. There are no choices to be made except whether to shoot or sneak behind obstacles which are haphazardly placed like those at a paintball event. It's pretty obvious when an enemy encounter is imminent as coherent level design gives way to random crates for you to hide behind.,,There are other annoyances too - sometimes your torch won't be pointing the same was as the light coming from it would suggest and ""infected"" will drop ammunition even though they have been zombies for ""years"" as one of the main characters comments.,,Stick with this game, however, and you will be rewarded - the story is what really makes this game great . I won't spoil the surprise by telling you too much but the relationship between the two main characters and how that relationship develops is captivating. The environments are pretty enough by PS3 standards but you won't be waxing lyrical about them if you are used to PC visuals. As mentioned earlier, the crafting mechanic adds a lot to the game and the limited availability of ammunition and weapons makes finding either feel like Christmas each and every time. It's just a shame that enemies don't drop ammo relevant to the weapon they are using. It's little things like that which break the immersion in the game.,,Overall the last of us is a good effort. It takes some decent if ""safe"" gameplay, tarts it up with a few interesting little elements and then smothers it in a great story. People say this is more of an interactive film than a game and I can see their point. You come back to it in the same way you come back to an episode of your favourite TV series - curious to find out what happens next. Ultimately though, however good the story is, it can't disguise the linear, by the numbers gameplay and that simply isn't good enough in this day and age of open worlds and decisions which have consequences.,,It's a solid 8 and everyone should play it but ratings of 10 out of 10 are just silly.",normal,ps3,2014-01-16,English,0,0,8,train

Everything performs so smoothly the control scheme disappears. You can almost forget you're playing a game.,,Because resources like ammo are scarce, you're always trying to deal with or avoid enemies in quiet ways without alerting them. Like silent takedowns, which are a real pleasure, and take just long enough to make you nervous someone's buddy will spot you doing it.,,There are also some upgrades available, both to your character, and even more fun, to your individual weapons.

flyingdonut55,"This is a very violent, dark, yet beautiful adventure brought in a very masterful way that few gaming companies (and writers) do. It´s not like Uncharted at all, where the action is in your face every five seconds: this game keeps a slow pace, and it kept my attention all the way through. I don´t think I felt so engaged to a pair of characters so much since Bioshock Infinite. Naughty Dog made a fantastic work into Joel and Ellie, and I absolutely loved Ellie´s development as, both a survivor and a badass female protagonist, a very brave teenager living in a cruel and rough world with Hunters and Bloaters on the way. Gameplay was ferocious, violent and intense, with lots of unique survivor horror elements, and I liked how Joel´s anger when he fights, combined with the context in the combat sections as well knowing the enemy, really made me hate the Hunters and Fireflies standing in my way, thus proving a very intense (and dramatic) gameplay experience. Now, it´s not without its faults: friendly A.I. was sometimes sloppy, and it had some glitches, like when an enemy was stuck in a chair or table after I strangled him, it would move in a very creepy way. But in the end, this was an emotional experience, with a very shocking ending, and I would definitely replay it again. Game of the Generation?

ShermheadRyder,"I'm going to start this review by making a bold statement. The Last of Us is the best PlayStation 3 game you will ever play. The timing of this game's release, a few months before the PlayStation 4 is no co-incidence. The PS3 has had a good run, but developers have finally reached the limit with the quality of gaming they can produce, but what a way to finish.,,The Last of Us is set in the U.S.A. after the cordyceps infection has ravaged the human race, turning humans into vicious, aggressive, almost rabid-like creatures. The game follows the story of Joel, as he attempts to smuggle Ellie, who is immune to the disease, across the country to safety, with plenty of surprises on the way (I'm being deliberately vague to avoid spoilers). The plot almost resembles a movie script rather than a video game; you'll understand if you've played the game. The ending (again without giving away any plot details) brilliantly leaves the plot open for a sequel; Sony also recently registered domain names relating to The Last of Us 2 and The Last of Us 3  read into that what you will.,,Whilst technically a linear game, The Last of Us is probably as close to an open-world game as a linear can be; exploration, strategy and resources play a key part in the game. The combat system in The Last of Us is probably as a real a combat experience as you will get on a video game. Much like real-life, resources are very limited and weapons are very powerful. You can't simply hide from enemies and wait for your health to regenerate, instead the player must use health packs, which can be either acquired or created by the player using resources.,,The player can use a variety of firearms in the game, ranging from pistols, to shotguns, to hunting rifles. As ammunition is hard to come by, as in reality, players are often better off using melee weapons, such as baseball bats and planks of wood. Both firearms and melee weapons can be upgraded using parts (a resource which can be found).,,Resources are one of the most important aspects of The Last of Us, the player can use them as weapons, ammunition, to distract enemies, replenish their health, upgrade weapons or to access certain areas. Resources such as health packs can also be created by crafting raw materials collected by the player.,,The player also has the ability to upgrade weapons using collectable tools, and the opportunity to upgrade their character by collecting bottles of pills.,,Whilst it's clear that Naughty Dog focused on the single-play, they have included a multiplayer element as well. Like other Naughty Dog games, it's relatively poor compared to the single-player, but The Last of Us' multiplayer, known as Factions, is a good attempt. The multiplayer takes place in the same environment as the game. Players choose one of two Factions, Fireflies (in yellow) and Hunters (in blue). There are no special abilities which are unique to any faction. The player leads a clan of survivors through 12 weeks, gathering supplies in order to advance the clan. Each match counts as one day, and supplies must be gathered to supply the clan; if the necessary supplies aren't gathered then clan members will begin to get hungry, get ill or die. Clan members can then be healed by reaching the required numbers of supplies. The Factions game mode can also be linked to Facebook.,,To sum it up, The Last of Us will be, in my opinion, the best PS3 exclusive you will ever play, and possibly the best game you'll ever play on PS3 (the only real game that could compete with it is Grand Theft Auto V). The plot will keep you entertained for hours, and probably more.",normal,ps3,2014-01-03,English,3,3,10,train
TheHonestCynic,"The Last Of Us is a benchmark in storytelling, characters, atmosphere, and gameplay. How long has it been since we got a zombie(-esque) game with a story we really care about? Naughty Dog took a genre that had been limited to ""exploding heads and that's it"" and created a true masterpiece.,,I'm sure you've heard enough about how fantastic the story is, but not enough can be said about it. It would be a tremendous mistake to buy this game and skip all the cutscenes. The pacing and storytelling are brilliantly done and oscar-worthy. The casting for the voice actors was done carefully, and each and everyone delivers an incredible and believable performance. And I mean that. From Joel and Ellie, to random bandits, to even the infected who can still scream incoherent phrases. Each and every character is done extremely well. The story itself is dark and unexpected. For the first time in a while I felt like anything could happen. Any character could die, there was no one who was going to make it out of this game alive for certain. And that's a wonderful thing.,,When you're not marvelling at the brilliantly crafted story, you're immersing yourself in a true survival experience. Playing this game on easy would be another mistake. Moderating your ammo, picking and choosing whether to engage in combat or sneak past, crafting explosives and melee weapons out of parts you find on the ground or in cupboards. It all seems so real, and so fun. There are parts when the gameplay falls a bit flat. Sequences where you need to sneak carefully to avoid clickers often results in your companion obnoxiously stomping around or speaking in a normal voice. While this doesn't actually affect you in any way, it really breaks immersion and tension.,,Graphically, the game comes close to challenging some games on the next gen. It's gorgeous, and has some of the best lush environments and lighting I've seen. It creates beautiful vibrant environments when it needs to, and throws you into a dark, broken, and drab world when it suits the story. It constantly reminds you what has happened to this world and never breaks the realm of reality. The character models are done extremely well too. I've never seen such accurate and realistic facial and body movements in and out of cutscenes.,,A small thing that's worth mentioning as well is the soundtrack. Gustavo Santaolalla has composed a brilliant soundtrack that's simple, but so emotional. They're used perfectly in the right moments and are never overbearing. It subtly creates an incredible atmosphere and it's the only gaming soundtrack to date that I have downloaded and listened to over and over again.,,When the story mode of The Last Of Us is done, the game is far from over. Naughty Dog put a lot of effort into an extremely underrated and unique multiplayer experience that doesn't at all fell like an afterthought. With an array of weapons, perks, challenges, and survivors to keep alive, the multiplayer is guaranteed to keep you entertained for a good while.,,Overall, The Last Of Us is among the very few games that deserves a 10 and nothing else. Sony couldn't have ended the generation of the PS3 any better",normal,ps3,2014-01-02,English,4,4,10,train

I don't care what you think otherwise but this 50$ or £40 is the best you'll spend/or would spend in 2013/2014 Naughty Dog outdid themselves with this, it is even better than a classic  for the PS one 'Crash Bandicoot'.Although the start is very hard to swallow with the slowness and the death of his daughter,but that over comes itself with the bondage that him and Ellie grow over the course of this magnificent game. The detail here is mind blowing it pushes the PS3 to the limit,i'm glad i chose this console over the XBOX 360 becuase even though if i had an XBOX 360 i would go out my way and buy a PS3 and this game,and i would play it over and over,but i have already done that and i saved some money also.All pf this was based on the Single Player,now onto the MP or what it's called in the menu 'Factions'.This game wouldn't need that game mode,it would still get those 10/10's 5/5's and 100./100's but with that stealth/survivor mode it makes the game so more fun and adds much replay value.In that mode you start with nearly nothing and it makes you open little red tool boxes with the tools part and crafting materials so you can help your team win.You going have to choose between the rebellion side and the Firefly side which are mentioned in the single player and Joel must help the firefly leader to deliver a 'Package'.But in here you don't come close to do stuff like that,you have your own 'clan' that you must need to feed and expand by doing good in your matches and then you collect 'food' to make sure your survivors are healthy  well fed and not hungry.,,If you are wanting to buy this masterpiece of a game i recommend doing it now,this moment,run.,And if you have an XBOX buy a ps3 and this game or buy the game and go to a friend that has a ps3 push him out the way and play it.",normal,ps3,2014-01-02,English,2,2,10,train

It's all about survival you can't help but get right into the storyline as the characters are just average normal people it's so easy to relate to them and put yourself in that situation.,,The graphics, the locations, the backdrop, the noises, the music has all been carefully put together and is totally in sync with each other. The atmosphere is frightening with strange noises or footsteps echoing around the corner.,,No negatives at all to speak of (wish the storyline lasted longer as it is so good is the only thing). This game is close to perfection and totally unique.

Although I've been a casual game player for over 25 years across various platforms, I'm pretty selective about what I play and spend my money on.,,In my opinion, this has to be one of the best games ever. As a mother, I could identify with the loss of Joels daughter in the beginning (what a tense, standout opening scene!) as well as Ellie's loss of her parents and friends. I thought she was a great female character, swearing and all! Joel was also an excellent protagonist, not only dealing with the loss of his daughter but also handling the responsibility of caring for Ellie. I loved the overall story, narrative and game play. Whilst the enemies were a bit predictable, the plot was not, and I enjoyed the various twists and turns along the way.,,I really liked the fact that they progressed Ellie from a girl who was barely allowed to hold a weapon at the beginning of the game to a character who ended up wielding knives, guns and a rather nasty machete to good effect at the end due to the changing circumstances and challenges of their situation.,,Game play is very immersive and atmospheric  working out whether to go in guns blazing or try to sneak around or even silently stalk and strangle an enemy makes every scene a mini mental challenge, especially if your ammo or health is low. Some of the scenarios in the gloomier parts of some buildings are pretty tense and definitely make for a few heart- stopping moments!,,Overall, a memorable game and well worth every penny.",normal,ps3,2013-12-31,English,1,1,10,train

william-james88,"The Last of Us fails as a game. Now now, that may not be bad. It just means that I dont care for it at all as a gaming experience. I am new to gaming and have a very black and white approach to games. All that I ask is to have some fun in this interactive experience.,,There are sections in the last of us, where you will be thrown so many enemies that you will feel overwhelmed and that is what the creators want you to feel. What they do not want you to do is try to fight them off and they impose that by making the enemies invincible in those moments. They will fall, appear dead, and then get back up again and again for no reason other than to tell you that you are not supposed to fight them in this scene and that you should run instead.,,This is MENTAL. Especially for a cinematic game which does not want to take you out of the immersion. If I cant fight them, then why not just have a cutscene of Joel getting into the car as soon as he was able to instead of having to realize it for myself. It’s like the game also wants to be a game and not just a movie you can experience playing. But it messes up by doing so. This is one example of many instances where you feel forced to certain actions, limiting  your options and your control over what you do. During a stealth segment, the game can decide to have your accompanying npcs either talk loudly, walk around or even worse shooting at the creatures. Talking loudly and walking around will throw you out of the immersion instantly but it’s not as bad as when the NPCs decide to shoot because the game will actually react to that and enemy attention will be drawn. Did I mention these enemies kill you instantly? Just great. The checkpoint system is also very flawed and frustrating. It can save right before one of those instant kill enemies notice you and everytime you load up the game, you die again and again, forcing you to restart the section.,I am dragging, but what I mean to say is that in a game that prioritizes story, making it overly difficult and having purposeful glitches and NPCs not concerned with the environment, just keeps adding distance between you and the game. It isn’t fun to play in that sense and the great story can’t be enjoyed as much. This is very much unlike Walking Dead, which has a similar story and environment but has the gameplay be simple for one to follow the story as closely as possible with no frustrations.,,I had no interest in playing the game after about 10 hours of playing it. I felt no reward from playing it, no fun. I dreaded every encounter because I knew it was just there for it to be called a game (because a movie about this would be unoriginal in this day and age, especially with Cormac McArtney's The Road). So I went on youtube and looked at someone else beating the game at the end. The combat was boring but I got the resolution of the ending and I preferred it this way because the guy playing was a pro and I didn’t have to worry about dying at every turn just to get to the end. I literally had more enjoyment from watching this play out as a video than playing it. That, my friend, does not make it a game in my book.",normal,ps3,2013-12-31,English,3,2,6,train

DGDrocks7,"We are now within the final years of the PS3, and Naughty Dog decided to make them the finest. It's like they took ""Uncharted"", ""Resistance"" and ""Heavy Rain"" together, and made what we call ""The Last of Us"". I'm no fan of horror games, so I don't know how their supposed to be in general, but to me this game was very scary. The stealth sections just intensify that fear; so much that I feel like going guns blazing to get over it. And while you can go gun blazing, it has its costs: you put yourself and other allies at greater risk, and you end up wasting ammo. Speaking of ammo, you really must conserve as you can't carry much, and finding ammo is rare. And when you do find it, it's not much. So use your guns as a FINAL RESORT. And no rechargeable health here either; it's back to finding medkits. And even though you can carry medkits, using them will leave you vulnerable.,,Now onto the story. It is one of the greatest and most personal stories ever written. This isn't about the disease, or mankind. It's about Joel and Ellie. They are very human and you'll want to see how their relationship develops over the course of the story. Not spoiling anything, but let's just say that there are times that will make you say, ""Would I have done that?"",,As for online, it's quite fun. You really need teamwork. And no gun-blazing or rechargeable health either. Leave you Call of Duty attitude at the door, and you'll do well.,,Games like these tell us not to abandon the PS3 yet.

Exxo97,"Ok so first things first I'm here to give an honest review not to praise or rip on the game, I'm going to point out all the flaws and positives withing Last of Us. Without further introduction here is my review of The Last of Us.,,Let's begin on a good note, Naughty Dogs is a remarkable studio, Crash and Jak are some of my favorite platformers ever and Uncharted provides a very fun narrative. But The Last of Us was very underwhelming in my eyes, simply because it was so hyped up and received so many 10s. I'm simply here to present evidence as why TLOU is not perfect, I'm not calling it a bad game by any means.,,My first negative statement is going to be about the genre most people classify this game under, survival-horror. This isn't true in my eyes I never once felt pressured to survive or scared at all, this game fits more under the third-person shooter or stealth genre but it is by no means a survival horror. Now to talk about something that actually matters, the story. I will  admit that The Last of Us does present a very well crafted story that is brought forth even more by the tremendous voice acting and animations, however I found the story to also be very predictable maybe that's because we are predictable creatures but that's not a valid argument as I often found myself  annoyed will how predictable the plot was, not to mention a plot like this has been seen before in other post-apocalyptic narratives The Walking Dead comes to mind quickly. Another thing The Last of Us is praised for is it's unique and memorable characters, but outside of Joel and Ellie I only found three characters that stuck with me: Sam and Henry two brothers that are just trying to get by and David, because he's a  dick. Overall I do think that The Last of Us has very good story, voice acting, and presentation. But that's where it starts to end for me.,,To me the core part of the negatives lie in the gameplay, the main reason I play a game. The gameplay is very reminiscent of Uncharted, excepted it's not nearly as good. The shooting mechanics are weighed down by the weapon sway, and before you jump on me yes I know this was intentional and that you can upgrade to fix this but it shouldn't have been implemented in the first place. Most people claim The Last of Us to be a very hard game when it's not at all, there is absolutely no penalty for dying as checkpoints are frequent. But the game does have some difficult moments and I see that those come from intentionally bad design; weapon sway, insta-kill enemies, swarms of enemies, enemies that can hit you even when your behind cover it's all so frustrating. And before someone starts saying it's for the sake of realism, Joel can see through wall by using sound.,,Earlier I praised the presentation, but outside of cut scenes there are some issues. Textures up close look just plain bad at times and there is texture pop-in, however these issues aren't very frequent but they're jarring when they do occur. Speaking of jarring how about that quick black transition before cut scenes, that tends to take me out of the experience at times and the only reason I'm making notice of this is because Uncharted handled transitions to cut scenes much better. And now it's time for the thing most people complain about is AI, my god it's polarizing. In some cases the enemies can shoot you perfectly from great distances and in others they have the perception of a genome soldier from MGS. But Ellie's AI is the worst as she won't stay still, this is a problem that severely puts me out of the experience and even more so companies in other games like Uncharted and Enslaved can stay put, so why can't Ellie?. But to leave on a positive note I absolutely love the crafting and weapon upgrade systems.,,To conclude TLOU does have a wonderful(yet predictable) story and the production values are top notch with great voice acting and animations. Nevertheless this game falls short in the one thing games need, gameplay. To match this there are AI issues, texture problems, and a forgettable soundtrack. I'm not saying TLOU is bad, not by any means, but it doesn't deserve all the perfect scores. Do to the repetitive and occasionally poor designed gameplay I'd rate this game a 7, however the story and presentation do help my experience. The Last of Us receives an 8 out of 10.",normal,ps3,2013-12-23,English,1,0,8,train

kayo83,"Honestly, after all the hype, I expected better. The games graphics, art, music and (especially) its story are top notch. The gameplay? Not so much. Way to repetitive and frustrating. There are 3 modes to this game.,,1) Walk/run exploring the impressive maps where you move stuff around solving puzzles, avoiding traps, and scavenge as much stuff as you can for its crafting to prepare you for  (see #2),,2) Sneak your way past a set of encounters which can either be human or infected (aka zombies). The most important yet worst part of the game. First of all, its one of ""those"" games which keep you low on weapons and ammo. So while you CAN, and probably will have to shoot and fight from time to time, its designed to have you sneak as much as possible. Fighting makes noise which attracts all the bad guys in the area, which will probably kill you if you stick around because your character is incredibly weak and your partner is incredibly stupid. You can also sneak up and melee using weapons you find and or craft but of course  they break easily. You can craft a shiv which have a very limited use (twice!) and even steel pipes break after a about 2 kills. Yeah  just 2.,,Then there are what are called Clickers. You'll come to hate them tremendously, and not in a good way. Can you kill them? First you have to snail your way to them because they have really good ears and can hear you even if youre sneaking. Then if youre lucky and want to waste your very limited weapon durability you may dispose of them. However 9/10 theyre near 2-3 other Clickers which are within hearing distance AND they kill you with one hit. You can use firearms if you wish but (a) they attract another 5 zombies in the area and (b)  theyre pretty resilient to bullets (even head shots). Meaning they will likely reach you.,,The best and least frustrating thing thing to do is to just sneak past everything. All this wouldnt be so bad if there was some variety, but its pretty much the same deal, every. single. time! Only difference is its in new areas.,,3) Watch cutscene. Probably the best part of the game but for that I could just watch a movie.,,Rise repeat.

Kinaibhlan,The Last of Us is more of an interactive movie than a game? There is lots of cutscenes and stuff which help the story but the gameplay is ok at best. I am not hating on the game I'm just saying the story is so good that it makes the semi repetitive gameplay not an issue. Hell I didn't even notice it while playing but once I was finished I didn't feel like playing it again. Some cheats would have been nice to help mix up the gameplay either to help or make it harder for you depending on the cheat. The online was horrible. Some things just kill you too fast like a Molotov or the stick. An offline mode with bots would have been nice but the game just has to have an online pass so no hope for offline multiplier with bots ever. Also a lack of game modes online is disappointing but that's not even what the game is about and doesn't effect my score on the game in the slightest.

CelesTial,"I'm one of those people who got TLOU expecting a masterpiece to be remembered for years, but found myself unable to connect to the Feelings so many others seem to have. It's not a bad game, but it's far from ""the best game ever"", as some call it. Let me explain.,,The prologue (the first playable sequence) showed a lot of promise. The story was very well presented, there were interactable objects all over the house that told me a bit more about the characters,and there were some calm, emotionally touching moments followed by the very exciting intro to the ""Zombie apocalypse"" scenario.,,Sadly, the intro was the best part of the game. The story then very abruptly changed to a point in time 20 years later with little explanation of what happened in the meantime, and the story ""evolved"" to a rather predictable relay race from one zombie-infested location to the next. Maybe others didn't find it as predictable, but I've watched and played a lot of zombie apocalypse scenarios since they became popular (the reason Ellie is special and needs to be saved has been done before, as well), and once you understand that the designers intend for you to keep sneaking or shooting your way past more and more clusters of infected with little to no meaningful human interaction in between, it's hard to be drawn in emotionally.,,There were no more interactive objects apart from occasional notes to pick up and read. Other characters can't be talked to apart from strictly scripted and linear FMVs (and in those, you can't even choose what answer you want to give), all those other survivors in the first location are just background decoration. The secondary main character remains a stranger for the most part, and you can't make any meaningful decisions that influence the story. The game is extremely linear. I had expected something more along the lines of The Walking Dead (by Telltale), whose story is 10 times more emotionally touching and exciting with the difficult decisions it forces you to make. Rather than just excuses to send more hordes of zombies at you at the next stop of the pre-determined relay race.,,I'm someone who cries very easily, even when reading books, but I absolutely cannot relate to the people who claim The Last of Us made them cry. There just wasn't enough story in between the linear zombie  human soldier mashing for me to care about the characters.,,As for the gameplay, it isn't bad, but both the sneaking and melee  shooting have been done better, by far. Enemies don't see you behind knee-high boxes, in full daylight, when they are one meter away, and the friendly NPCs with their awkward pathing run right into hordes of opponents (while you are carefully sneaking around) without being noticed. That is, if they're not blocking your way. Some help they are! Sneaking generally works well, but after the xth large group of clickers spread over multiple rooms it gets dull, it's not a challenge, just takes a long time because you need to move very slowly. Ammo is too limited for shooting to be a permanent alternative, so you're forced to sneak. Melee isn't always an alternative either, as clickers will grab and instakill you if you don't kill them with the first melee hit. Deus Ex Human Revoution shows how sneaking and shooting can blend together well in a single game (and how to make sneaking fun), the same isn't true here.,,The graphics are decent. Nothing world-shaking as some would have you believe, the FMVs are however very well done, with facial expressions that come close to Heavy Rain's quality.,,In a nutshell:,,-Story has been done MUCH better (The Walking Dead, Deus Ex HR, Heavy Rain etc). Extremely linear, no meaningful decisions, only a few randomly scattered notes to read apart from fully scripted FMVs.,-Sneaking was done better by the Thief series 10+ years ago, as well as others,-Shooter friends will be disappointed by the lack of ammo and forced to sneak,-Gameplay gets very repetitive, very small number of different infected and the same 2 or so types of human soldiers.,,I'd like to mention something that was truly ""great"" but nothing comes to mind. It's not a bad game, it was fun, though without any chair-gripping excitement or truly memorable moments. I'd recommend it at a reduced price, without high expectations.",normal,ps3,2013-12-17,English,2,1,7,train

HitmanRm95,"This game is strong and delivers a really strong story that is for people who would like things such as the walking dead. you end up getting attached to Joel and Ellie the two main characters as you venture through the world in a post epidemic. I cant tell the story of this game as there would be spoilers as the game has a lot of big moment's. The side kick in the story Ellie will develop into a real survivor while Joel is sort of like the mentor in a way. The first strong thing about the game is its soundtrack which is not too full of itself as it is not a collage of crazy sounds and noises that you would here in a pop music video. It is real music and you will get to liking it.  The second thing I like about this game is the character AI especially the enemy's you will encounter some better than others. My most likable AI is one of the bosses in the game as the AI made the boss fight extremely rememberable and clever. The use of the clickers the infected characters in the game is interesting as you have to literally make sure they don't bite you or its game over no matter if you are playing on hard mode or not. The game play all around is smooth for a third person shooter I don't have much difficulty with the controls while in combat which uses the clever AI I talk about. The game graphics wise is Beautiful and is settings are amazing. The game is not all action or drama there is also horror in some scenario's in which one of these made me scared even with a fully upgraded shotgun. you can build and upgrade weapons and items on your Journey however it took me two playthroughs to do this. The voice acting in this game is great as troy baker does just as good as a job as he has in other games. The last aspect of the game I will talk about is the multiplayer, it is a fun and balanced multiplayer that plays as smooth as the singleplayer game and  is at its best with friend's on headset's.

I wasn't careful. and completed the game in 2 days.  The graphics appear next-gen, despite being ps3.   Ellie and Joel are, to this day and forever, my favorite video game characters of all time.

justachair,"Naughty Dog has made a masterpiece. The best game PS3 has delivered in the entire sventh generation, and one that will be remembered for years to come. It is truly that good. And I know some jealous people will describe this game as overrated without even playing it, as the same thing happened last year with Halo 4. Shh, don't listen to them! The Last of Us is not flawless but is pretty damn close, and that is enough to give it everlasting praise.,The story, OMG! If you have a heart, and human feelings, and most importantly two eyes, two ears and a functioning brain, then you will love the story in this game. I never felt so many things, and I'm not talking only about TWD emotional post-depression, although there is definitely a hint of that. I am talking about anger, desperation, happiness and fear...and the worst fear of all. The fear of losing your loved ones. The voice acting is top-notch, and the graphics. They truly push the PS3 to the limit. They are insane.,The gameplay is fitting, and really pairs with the pace of the game. It is intense, gritty and insanely violent. Stealth is king (Something we are not used to from the ""Uncharted"" games) as it is also being tactical, preservative and crafty. If you play in normal (Like me) you will find some challenge, though not overwhelming. It is at moments fun, at moments scary. It is just a good-old fashioned survival horror stealthy gameplay, and I enjoyed the hell out of it.,Surprise! This game comes with an Online component which is, surprisingly good actually. It has the same gameplay mechanics from the campaign and the maps are thoughtfully designed. Of course it is not The Last of Us' main focus, but I am still playing it a lot, you know, after three entire playthroughs of the mind-blowing, excellent, five-star, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious campaign. Gotta love Ellie and her awful jokes!,In the end, BUY THIS GAME! Do not own a PS3? Bro, I feel for you, because this game is one of the best games ever made, period.

However, the game play is God-awful, I feel as though the game play is focused on stealth except all the focused on was the shooting aspect, the shooting works great, but will kill you instantly if you ever use it with zombies. One major thing that annoyed me was different types of zombies, no explanation behind how they came to be, just put in there in an attempt to make extra game play. However in the end, special zombies are what ruined the game for me and I'm sure many others, what makes them stronger? I don't know, no one knows.

Xleft4theDEADxX,"At first I'd like to get this off my chest. I really loved to play The Last of Us. It was an really enjoyable and emotional experience for me and it's one of the best games to be released in 2013. However; it had many flaws and is utterly overrated by the masses. The story is one of the highest claimed things about the game but to be honest, it wasn't that original, mostly cliché. It were the characters that carried it all. Even the intro sequence brought tears in my eyes. And that will mean something. On the technical side there isn't much to critize, but it isn't the best looking game on the PS3. I still think Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the best looking current-gen console game to date. Some textures were muddy but that's about it. What was the most let down to me were three things: At first the gameplay and the difficulity. The gameplay was probably one of the most boring things I have ever wittnessed. It made Heavy Rain look spectacular.,,Also it was really linear, the AI was dumb and the gunplay decent at best. But I just can't get over it how repetitive it all was. Always there was to find and build a ladder or a bridge and hold off some enemies and that's about it. And the difficulity was schizophrenic. At one time it was easy because of the stupid AI and then they threw in the Clickers that can kill you with one hit (at the beginning). Some may call it challenging, I call it a chore. And then the last chapter was really annoying too because of the sheer amount of enemies. The game has really low replayability for me. I tried to go for another run a while after I completed it but I just couldn't because it was so boring. It's a game you probably just will play once. To all the people who gave it a 10  How often did you replay the game you spent 60 bucks on? Because I think good games should be fun to replay. But this one wasn't at all.,,Then there's multiplayer. Normally I'm not a multiplayer guy but this one really got me hooked. It was even more enjoyable than the singleplayer most of the time. It requires a lot of tactic and teamplay. More than those wanna-be tactic games like Battlefield 3 and 4.,,Overall it's certainly not a bad game, it's very good to be sure but it's simply overrated. I think that's because it's a PlayStation exclusive. Most exclusive games on that platform that are actually just mediocre just get high scores because they look pretty and has the Sony brand on it.",normal,ps3,2013-11-27,English,0,0,8,test

It’s hard to aim making it more realistic, but you can upgrade you’re stats with supplements.  There are items you can craft such as health kits, grenades, upgrade melee weapon, bow, etc.  You must make use of your supplies as you progress through the game, and you must search houses, garages, everywhere to ensure you get everything(optional but if you don’t you may have a hard time further in the game).  It’s a linear experience, but one of the best experienced, alongside the Uncharted series.  For a survival game it’s one of the best I have ever played.  10.,,Story:  The game has a major impact at the start which no game has ever had.  After the game is a little bit slow building up the storyline, 2 hours later for the  story to progress.  Amazing moments in the middle, and near the end of the game, but I felt that while Naughty Dog didn’t leave a cliff hanger ending, they purposely left room to continue this New IP.  10.,,Replay Value:  The single player can range up to 20 hours, and there’s a multiplayer.

The story is so good because of how it is told, the characters, the music, the hundreds of subtleties. The gameplay is excellent as well and is extremely fun.

It all fit together beautifully even though this is not a shiny happy world. In fin, there really isn't anything wrong with this game except that fact that it had to inevitably end sometime. I just wish more people, who weren't gamers, could experience this story because a lot of people who love movies and books are really missing out and a lot of gamers as well like xbox owners and even some ps3 owners. The only way you might not like this game is if you really hate post apocalyptic setting.",normal,ps3,2013-11-13,English,2,1,10,train
IkqXP,"Definite quality, in-the-moment, challenging gameplay and an amazing story, The Last of Us offers something that is extremely powerful and immersive, in terms of experience of the player. Horrifying, heart-touching and deep at the same time, you know that the game is good if they deliver all these three qualities right out at the beginning. Aside from the rather questionable ending that ultimately alludes a sequel (the ending could have rather been more expanding), the game would've definitely deserved 10 out of 10.",normal,ps3,2013-11-13,English,0,0,9,train
MuriloBFS,"This is an amazing PS3 exclusive, a must buy for console owners.,,While I do believe the game is slightly overrated for reasons I'll be noting in the review, it is definitely the best PS3 game I've played this year.,,The game is just georgeous, there was a lot of effort put into details. Animations are realistic, and the environment is amazing. The art direction of this game did an awesome job, and to think this game runs on a 2006 console is astonishing.,,The gameplay feels great. It is not exactly fun all the times, but it's realistic enough, and coupled with the game's great storyline, it will keep you in front of your tv for hours.,,Both Ellie and Joel are quite likeable. The voice acting, sound effects, and music in general are incredible. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson both did a great job.,,The multiplayer isn't really a major deal, but still, it is a nice bonus. Interrogation mode, which was added with an update is a really innovative mode. Managing your crew through the 12 weeks is actually fun and challenging.,,Now, about the flaws...,,The game is mostly linear. You'll have to play the way it's meant to be played. If you try to fight in a place that ND wanted you to sneak pass or vice-verse, you'll have a hard time.,,A great example of this is the Sniper part. Unless you get yourself to the house he is, you can't progress the game. Even having a sniper rifle yourself, you can't kill him. It's just a ghost gun firing at you. Four times in a row in some instances (sometimes he doesn't have to reload).,,Enemies have unlimited ammo even though supplies are limited in this world. Upon death, the chances of them dropping the ammo they were using is quite low, especially on a higher difficulty level. It's not exactly a big deal, but it would be more immersive if they actually would run out of ammo and try other strategies to deal with you.,,The game lacks replayability for those who are not completionists. Sure, there's a lot of collectibles and trophies for people to get, but most players would just ignore stuff like that. Yeah, there's multiplayer, but as I said before, the multiplayer isn't a major attraction of the game.,,I've played the game on version 1.3 and yet I had some annoying bugs, including characters aiming with no weapons (even my own character), bad AI, actions not working (like, once I needed to help Ellie get to a ladder, but there was no ""Press triangle"") clickers grabbing me through walls (happened twice only, but still pretty annoying) among others.,,And last but no least... There's no way to install the disc version of the game. That's really bad, because if you play the disc version, you will encounter frame rate issues (first time you see a horse in the dam, for example) and the loading takes a lot of time. But that's about it.,,On everything else, this is truly an amazing game, definitely one of the big games of 2013. Really worth buying!",normal,ps3,2013-11-13,English,0,0,8,test

Symbiot911,"As with many reviewers on Metacritic I must start by saying that this is easily the best game I have ever played in my 30+ years of gaming. Never before have I been swept off my feet by a game and taken on an intense, emotional and visually stunning journey. I have played many great games over the years, but when a game can touch you to the extent that a week after finishing it I find that it is still on my mind, well, I reckon that is saying something. The VA and MC is in my humble opinion, second to none. The gameplay and tactics are awesome and the game, to it's credit, really doesn't give you much in the way of items in order to upgrade weapons and health, you really do have to scavenge and use what you find very wisely. I think also that being the father of two daughters not all that much older than Ellie really added to the emotional aspect of the game, in fact, I'm not ashamed to say that this bloody game made me cry on more than a few occasions and it has had the same effect on both my daughters, probably because they mean so much to me and they are so awesome that I can relate to Joel's emotional pain throughout the game. I can't really say much more than that without giving away too much info, needles to say, if there is one game that everyone should at least give a go it's The Last Of Us. Personally, I feel it craps on GTA though at the same same time they are completely different types of game but just based on their metascore, TLOU is deserving of a higher score, but that's just me, GTA is still an excellent game.",normal,ps3,2013-11-11,English,2,2,10,train

VideoGameJunkie,"I've been playing video games since 1978 when I got an Atari 2600 for Christmas.  In the past decade, I find it difficult to find a good game that really pulls you in and gets you hooked.  As a huge fan of Fallout 3, I was really looking forward to Last of Us as my next 'end of days' game.  Last of Us didn't disappoint.  The linear storyline forces you along- you have no choice, but to push forward.  You can't go back, level up, and return to an area with amped up stats, perks, etc.  You're scrounging for ammo and supplies and really have to put thought in to how you're going to get through that hunter-infested hotel ruin.  It's impossible to play 100% stealth, so be prepared for brutal melee fights and edge of your seat shoot outs.  I found myself hoping the next enemies were human, because the infected humans were absolutely insane and unpredictable.  Although the game is linear, it offers a great deal of exploration.  Ammo and crafting supplies are essential, but I wish the other collectibles offered a little more than atmosphere and an excuse to scour the area.  I don't care about ""achievements""- give me some sort of gameplay bonus.  (Ideal game design would grant you something that would be fun to use in the next playthrough- could be a weapon, ability, or access to unavailable parts of a map)  Key takeaway- PLAY THIS GAME.  It is truly an experience that will suck you in emotionally and you'll feel what Ellie and Joel are going through.  First playthrough is priceless- avoid all spoilers- and check this game out.",normal,ps3,2013-11-08,English,0,0,9,train

Kasu,"This game is another piece of brilliance from Naughty Dog. Having played Naughty Dog games since Crash Bandicoot and all of the Uncharted games, I sort of knew what was coming. The narrative is sort of a stretch from other ND games because it has a more serious and darker tone. For some game developers, changing the pace or going in a different direction, after releasing games of the same genre/ story, might be harmful. This is not the case here. ND is now becoming somewhat like Rockstar in the sense that they are putting out quality instead of quantity *cough cough IW, Treyarch*,,This game follows Joel and his sidekick Ellie, who must survive in a post apocalyptic world after a virus, has caused the citizens of the world to become more zombie-like. If you have ever played any past Uncharted game then you will feel right at home with how the controls and quick actions are added into the story. This game has you either play as a stealthy type of player or straight shooter, neither or bad nor good. However supplies are limited either way so you must play smart. Ellie is not only for looks, though that’s bad for me to say because she is still a child. But what I mean is that she isn't just some girl in the way, she can change the tide of encounters by getting involved with the enemy. This is a plus for the game because you are not just baby sitting some girl, she helps you so you'll never feel alone. Overall I must say that the single player is well done and brings another great story to the player.,,The online portion was something I wasn't completely a fan of but it was definitely something different and in a good way. The online portion of the game pitted you in a small group against another small team in various game modes. The combat seemed fair and balanced and also frustrating. The online component wasn’t the best from ND but it did supply some fun.",normal,ps3,2013-11-07,English,0,0,9,train
Ciecieji,"The fact that this gets such rave reviews is a testament to the fact that the video game industry needs real writers.  The story is...alright, really.  If this was a move or TV series, I strongly believe it would have gotten a tepid reaction -unnecessary plot lines, strange pacing, filler segments, predictable twists, erratic behavior/ out of character moments, ect...  but for game writing it's awesome, the characters are usually believable, the acting is good and the core of the story is solid, and those are the primary merits of the game.  Those are the reasons that no-one is mentioning the samey enemies (I feel like I fought about three types of guys who were continuously re-skinned throughout the game) nobody mentions the copious backtracking that occurs throughout the game, nobody mentions the wonky controls which make it difficult to land precise shots on rapidly moving enemies, nobody dwells on getting lost inside stages with little indication on where to go/what to do to progress (I'm looking at you University Stage).  Honestly, they delivered a solid experience on most fronts, but thanks to pushing the envelop on the story front for video games, where honestly the bar isn't all that high, everyone forgets to nitpick the game play and level design features and fall head over heels for the game.,I lost my motivation to play around the time that I had to backtrack through waves of generic spawns (why are their so many bandits raiding abandoned locations in the post apocalypse where humanity is barely hanging by a thread, anyway?) after discovering the abandoned firefly base.  I basically forced myself to play out the rest of the game, partially because I had invested so much time in it, and partially because I thought I was closer to the end than I, in fact, was.,It should be obvious that I wasn't quite as enamored with the story as the majority of reviewers, but I think that most of those reviews would find that, if they put the story aside, what's underneath is a solid, but unremarkable action/stealth game hybrid.

At a basic level there are three facets that make up how to judge a game great from a bad one to me and they're not mutually exclusive; the gameplay, the story and the graphics (including the sound!). The Last of Us gets 10/10 for the latter two but it's only slight drawback was the gameplay. Only inasmuch as it did get a little repetitive. However, it was still a definitive 10/10 overall for me, largely because of the excellent story. It is something of a rarity that games inspire such immersion and relation to the characters. Like a good book it had me rushing home from work, desperate to find out what happens next. You could argue that the story arc is a little basic perhaps even predictable, but that doesn't hinder it. It is the pacing that makes it supreme. There's moments when you might feel that it's all going to be ok, or that you're safe, you're strong and have lots of supplies. Then the next you'll be struggling, grasping for control again. Furthermore, its the characters realism that really draws you in. In combination with those moments of complete panic and tranquillity you really get to know the characters. Aesthetically its excellent; immersive, detailed and at times quite beautiful.,,Overall, as I said, it's one of (if not the) best game I've had the pleasure of playing.

Whether it be sadness or joy, this game has done it. Naughty dogs newest game is a pinnacle of storytelling, starting from a heart-breaking beginning to an ending that has been on my mind for weeks.,Visually this game astounds me. The characters are so human and the environment, believable. The visuals enhance the fantastically violent nature of survival and at one time or another made me wince. This is not a negative factor however as it amazes me.,,The storyline granted is slightly cliché but just because someone did it before, doesn't mean it cant be done again. Not only was it done again but it exceeded any predictability with strong emotional connection to the characters and feelings of utter hopelessness at times. The gameplay is incredibly fun as no two battles need to be the same. Some argue that the game is linear but I argue back by saying ""its not linear, you just chose not to explore"". You have choices of weapons to modify and make and in doing so might help you or hinder you in the future. You need to plan ahead to survive.,,The soundtrack is beautiful and suits perfectly to the apocalyptic yet beautiful wasteland of America. The collapse of man of course caused by the cordyceps. basing a disease on a real life fungus adds to the believability that one day this could happen. The enemies in the game are split into hunters  melee. gunners, Molotov throwers, armoured) and the infected. the infected change through grotesque stages, each more deadly than the last. they are creative and very fun to kill.,The only problem I found in the game was made to counteract an even greater one. your allies are sometimes invisible to the enemy until you are exposed. This sometimes breaks immersion but was done so that the whole game doesn't become one whole escort mission which it definitely is not. Some people may say that the enemy A.I is braindead. Some people give this game a 0 for this one reason. Some people are stupid.,,My verdict is that this game deserves all the praise it gets because it deserves it. It isn't overrated and certainly isn't bad. this game will be remembered for generation. This is for the Ps3 what Mario was for the NES.

I've never felt such a level of empathy towards the characters of a game, I never needed to keep the characters alive so much (maybe my closest empathetic experience was with Heavy Rain, but that experience was very different). It is worth to mention that I don't like zombies-alike horror films and I usually get bored watching (most of) action films. I don't know why, but maybe it's because I know that the main character will live, so there is no real thrill. Is the hero caged in a locked room? meh, he will find out a way to escape, I'm not afraid. Is the bad guy aiming at the hero? Something weird will happen and he will stay alive, sure. But there is something very different in videogames: you can die, so you have a reason to be tense. Of course, videogames typically suffer from a problem which was pointed out by Steven Spielberg: ""The second you get the controller something turns off in the heart, and it becomes a sport."" Well, maybe it's true for most of games. For instance, I'm thinking about GTA V, which is a great game indeed, but it's just a ""game"" in the sense pointed out by Spielberg: characters are not really touching (they are funny, but not touching), so it's a kind of great ""sports"" game: driving, shooting, flying, etc. Oddly, some of my best moments in GTA V were when I was driving through this huge world, perhaps in the coast highway during the sunset, and I felt that I was in a kind of long journey. Isn't it weird? However, The Last of Us is very different. After 4-5 hours playing or so, you will really empathize with the characters so much until the end  in a level not reached by most of Mr. Spielberg films in my own case, by the way (Ok, The Schindler List was something very different). The Last of Us characters are very well defined, and you will share their suffering for a long time until you love them. They are touching despite they rarely show openly their feelings, which is a symptom of a great performance. In addition, you will feel nervous in dangerous situations because you can die indeed. So you have the best combination of films and videogames: ""the characters are touching""  ""you really feel that you can die""  ""you really feel you are there."" The previous formula shows the rare achievement of this game. My conclusion is that this is a rare experience you will never forget.",normal,ps3,2013-10-30,English,0,0,10,test

WhiskeyShot,"So I've been a gamer for 25 years.   Created a Metacritic account solely so that I could rate this game a 10.   It's unquestionably one of the very best games ever made, and I've been pondering whether it's the best single player game I've ever played.    To be honest, I've grown weary of single player games over the last 2+ decades.    It's often a struggle to finish a single player game because I lose interest.    I fill my limited gaming hours in a week with a staple of Battlefield due to the fact that playing with other humans is usually more stimulating than the rehashed, trite and unimaginative content to be found in most single player games.,,This game is one of those once in a decade gems, managing to pull together the epic scale and perfect pacing of Half-Life 2, the grandeur and wonder of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the irrepressible spirit of adventure of Uncharted 2/3 and the emotional hook in your gut of Ico into a game that continues to resonate with me long after the end credits stopped rolling.   The artistry and subtlety involved with the characterization alone is thesis-worthy.   It is a game that captivated, riveted and wholly entertained me as a gamer from the first minute to the last, sans flaw.,,The Last of Us is a complete and special gaming experience and serves as a paradigm shift for storytelling in interactive media.

Jalopicus,"The Last of Us is the best zombie movie you've ever played.,,First of all, the no-consequence-for-dying argument has been flogged to an inconsequential death in regards to this game, so I will say this:  seeking consequence in a video game is barking up the wrong tree.  Combat with realistic consequences driving survival would be something like a war rather than a game and it would likely have little entertainment value.,,That said, I'm satisfied with calling TLoU an adventure game with survival as the central theme if it circumvents the tired old comparison of every survival-themed game with Dark Souls and Demon Souls.  In fact, I'm happy to report that TLoU is nothing like either of those.,,The Last of Us is a captivating and immersive experience that is worthy of the ""masterpiece"" praises that it has received.  Fast-paced at times and a slow-burn at other times, it manages to keep attention and not become completely boring or stale.  It has its tropes, but they aren't damaging to the overall experience.,,Stealth is centered around being very quiet, as the zombies in this game are blind.  It's a good idea and executed well for the most part, but it does make for some awkward moments with an AI partner.  There are times when the AI will seem to stomp around at will without being noticed; meanwhile if you so much as break wind, the turbulence in your jeans will alert every zombie in the area of your delicious presence.  It's not a mechanics issue or anything, it just looks like an odd contrast and it's one of the few things in the game that seems sloppy.,,Character development is so strong that it's easy to become invested, but at the same time it doesn't feel forced you.  In fact, you might not even notice until you find yourself blowing through half of your ammunition on a relatively harmless mob just because they got a little too rough with Not-Ellen-Page.,,Multiplayer can be quite fun because it's quite a different approach, but at the same time multiplayer can be no fun at all because the differences fall apart.  The focus is on collecting parts and supplies in order to sustain your clan of survivors and that doesn't necessarily correlate with kills alone.  In fact, a support role is just as effective in collecting parts by crafting, healing, reviving, etc than those meant for a high kill count.  However, you may often find that matches are overtaken by a haphazard run-and-gun approach that ruins the tactical slow-burn that it intends.  This is being addressed with various combat balances but the MP still seems at risk for drastic dissolution of its population over time.,,Multiplayer also seemed drastically under-realized on release as it featured only two game modes (neither of which involved surviving hordes of zombies).  It has since revealed plans to expand the game modes through DLC and has already begun to do so.  On one hand, more game modes are a welcomed addition but on the other hand they shouldn't turn the game into an 80 dollar version.,,Overall, a great experience with nothing blatantly wrong with it.  Multiplayer will be take-it-or-leave-it as usual, but single-player alone makes TLoU a great game.",normal,ps3,2013-10-21,English,0,0,9,train

padako,"A good attempt by Naughty Dog but this game left me wanting more. The character relationships felt forced and unnatural while the game play is often boring. I enjoyed the overall story and the ending but getting there felt like a slog. Many of the action sequences are redundant and the game doesn't do much that hasn't been done before. Even some of the more tense sequences had a very ""been there, done that"" feel to them. The puzzles are very easy and almost feel unnecessary in that way. If you are going to include puzzles, at least make the fun and interesting to solve. The scavenging and crafting make sense and fit well in a survival game like this but the system could have been fleshed out a lot more. Finding half broken scissors to build shivs and shrapnel bombs loses it's effect after the 100th time you do it. The graphics are great for a current gen game and the cinematics are integrated well.

Eradan,"I bought a PS3 for this game. I watched the E3 video and a gameplay video of the intro. Such immersive beauty! Just before the titles, I pressed pause and went to buy a console.,I expected a mature game of explorations, ingaging strategic combat, an original and fullfilling storyline all tied together with a smart gameplay. I was very disappointed and that's why:,- The story is not well written, but i don't want to spoiler this in case someone will play the game anyway.,- The intro is misleading, the rest of the game will not see the plot develop while you're playing. It goes like this: you enter an area, you kill the dumb enemies, reach a certain point  cutscene  next area. Every area has a patethic excuse to reach the next (like, ""hey i need a car, so let's walk across a block full of infected to find a car battery""), after a while you wont even remember why you're escorting a little brat and where.,- Exploration is absolutely linear (non existent). You cross a lot of cities, but every gate, every stair ramp, every door is closed but the ones you have to take. If a room is open it means that that's your path or a little decoy to refill your ammo/health/powerups. This is not well hided, there are no tricks to make the world seem continuous. You WILL see a door just closed as any other and no way to try to open it or you will climb a ramp of stairs to find a wall of junk that doesn't let you pass. Sometimes you simply wander like an idiot trying to find the hole you have to climb in. Sometimes you will have to push a little cart, move a stairs or push your friend over an edge to reach the next area. But there's no brainer here, you just have to push a button and the trick is always the same.,- This is a combat game, don't be fooled. You enter an area, there will always be obvious placed repairs to hide, the enemies will ALWAYS be alert and patroling (no immersion here, every zone is a tactical zone) you can cross them while they're talking but after some useless dialogue lines they will patrol again, even in some remote zone of the world (this to make you understand that there's ZERO immersion in this fictional world, every level is a tactical level). It doesn't matter if you've mastered every FPS, military tactical or stealth game since doom: you will die, a lot. The patrol will always walk towards you, even if you're in the dark behind a counter, they will take 3 gunshots from a little distance and still have the strenght to hit you with a crowbar and god the zombies are dumb. Ammo should be rare but they will drop from enemies proportionally to your usage and your partner will refill you (with med kits too). The glorious animations that made us tremble in hype from the E3 trailer will quickly become boring.,,This is a truly overrated game. I can't understand why people are praising it, every aspect is mediocre (graphics are good, but not THAT good).

RainingSkills,"This game defines what a masterpiece is. It sets an incredibly high standard for future video games, not only from Naughty Dog, but from all game developers. The Last of Us shows us what the PS3 is truly capable of when pushed to it's fullest potential. It runs incredibly smooth on my PS3 Slim, and the graphics are jaw-dropping. Throughout the game, you really feel a connection to the characters. You get to know them, and you get to feel them. The story keeps you craving more, and its gameplay is nothing short of addicting.,,Then, just to make the game even better, they throw in some incredible multiplayer. There isn't a whole lot of variety, with only three game modes and not too many maps, but I think the simplicity helps the multiplayer succeed more. More maps would be nice, but three game modes is enough for the time being. All three are very fun, and they're all more enjoyable if you work as a team, especially when playing Interrogation.,,I experienced a couple of bugs with the game, but none directly impacted my gameplay. One was just somebody running through a wall (just a random NPC), and the other was a multiplayer glitch, where the one of the Survival Skills wouldn't unlock.

And between sequences of merciless slaughter you got to watch a beautiful cutscene...Only for it to lead into another sequence of merciless slaughter. Rinse and repeat for 15 hours and that's 'The Last of Us."",,Remove all those shooting sequences, what are you left with? A movie. If I wanted to watch movie I'd go to my local theater and pay 12 bucks as opposed to 60. ""The Last of Us"" lacks all the things needed to make it a videogame.,,There's a one button crafting system that relies on the same three ingredients. That's only other game mechanic besides walking and shooting. (Oh and sometimes hiding and shooting.) The only puzzles in the game relied on floating pallets and witty banter.

TheLizardKing,"The Last of Us is an experience that is rarely witnessed in video games. I have never played a video game that has questioned the moral choices of the player, not in a Mass Effect way, but in a way that makes the player wonder if they agree with the actions of Joel and Ellie. And speaking of Ellie, she is one of the all time great female characters in all of media in my opinion: Brave, loyal, funny and arguably, the glue that holds the Joel and Ellie partnership together, something that is greatly questioned and emphasized in the game at a certain moment. In addition, the graphics are supreme, the motion-capture and voice acting is incredible, the tense and dangerous atmosphere and gameplay is a reminder of the early Resident Evil games, and the story is one of the all time greats in any form of media.,In conclusion, a wonderful, heart-breaking and brutal experience that the people at Naughty Dog should be showered in praise for. This game is one of the all time greats and is a diamond in the crown of Sony and Naughty Dog",normal,ps3,2013-10-10,English,2,2,10,train
beanstar,"If you were in a time when the world is coming to an end, and there was a chance to save it  why not give up that chance for the ones you love, despite on its costs? Naughty Dog dares to answer that question in making one of the most emotional, brutally violent, understandable experiences I've ever played  and that is The Last of Us, one of the most critically-acclaimed games of 2013 thus far, and again, the best game on the PS3 this year. From the tragic moments of the prologue to the brutal action sequences, unexpected plot twists (deaths, betrayals, and change-of-minds), and the non-easy conclusion (which will not forgotten by those who will or had play it)  it was worth playing it all for over (depending on your skill and profession) between 9 and 17 hours of campaign mode. The multiplayer is also a big highlight, as well, but nearly all of its shine comes from the single-player mode, which contains amazing performances (particularly of Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson as our two heroes), an impressive amount of gameplay mixed with an outstanding story, and one of the greatest video game scores of all time. Traveling with Joel and Ellie across the United States is one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had in gaming, and it has been a honor playing Naughty Dog's last love letter to the PS3.

AwesomeReviewer,"""The Last of Us"" is unlike anything I’ve ever played before. I’ve always found stories in video games intriguing and some of them even get me emotional, but for the first time ever, I feel like a video game has rivaled some of Hollywood’s greatest stories. From the very beginning, this game absorbs you in emotionally, I was literally crying within the first ten minutes. As the story progresses, there are multiple moments where I noticed myself tearing up and getting a lump in my throat. These moments don’t only occur during the cinematic cut scenes, but through normal game play, especially as you near the end.,,The story of “The Last of Us” is about survival as our heroes try to make it to the Fireflies, a resistance group, to find a cure for the infestation of plant-like zombies. Along the way they face the infected and other humans who, much like them, are trying to survive the harsh environment created by the infected outbreak. Through this journey, themes of survival, sacrifice, loyalty, fate, and hope are all tackled and handled very well to where by the end, you begin to question some of the decisions made by the characters.,,The game play is superb and the controls are solid. I had a weird time adjusting to the controls, but within a couple of hours, I couldn’t imagine myself playing it any other way. The game play on the other hand is quit satisfying. The melee, shooting, stealth, and cover system are all executed well. The great part about the game play is that it requires the player to think, rather than just rely on a couple of weapons or strategies. Ammo is very scarce and guns in general attract a lot of attention, so when playing you must be smart about using it. Weapons also break and you are required to make some of them yourself, however, the challenge is finding the right materials. This game is also pretty hard. The A.I. is incredibly intelligent as they react to your slightest mistakes and capitalize on it. So you’ll be in constant terror of enemies appearing out of nowhere and just ruining some of your progress.,,The characters, Joel and Ellie, are fantastically written. Joel is a hardened survivor, who has a lot of baggage and is very closed off emotionally, but also has a strong protective instinct. Ellie is a foul mouthed teenager, who, much like Joel, is all alone in this world and has to learn to grow and become more independent. There are so many little quirks to these characters that make them seem so very real and relateable. For instance, when nothing is happening and Joel is just scavenging around, Ellie will start whistling or humming. These little things make us fall in love with these characters. Their interactions are charming as they have a father daughter relationship and it great watching it develop. All the supporting characters are fantastic as well and one thing to really appreciate is that there are no blatant black and white character. Not even our heroes can be justified as “do-gooders” as everyone has a reason for what they are doing. The voice work is some of the best I’ve ever heard. The voice actors really put a lot of effort into making these characters radiate off the screen.,,Visually this game is amazing. The character designs and movement are pleasing to the eyes. The bleak and apocalyptic world that has been crafted is something to marvel at as there are a lot of little things to look out for. The architecture and environments all have a story to tell of what might have happened. It’s a world that we don’t want to live in as there is nothing that remotely resembles an ideal living location. However, when, we actually do see signs of beauty, much like how the characters react, we too get a sense of wonderment. The musical score is also beautiful. Most of the time it’s very subtle and almost not there, but when something is about to go down, it kicks in. Giving us feelings of sheer fear for our lives in the more survival orientated moments to a more emotional sensation in the intense story driven moments.,,Overall, “The Last of Us” is a truly amazing game that must be experienced by everyone and has become my personal favorite of all time. It is a game that isn’t revolutionary in its concept, but groundbreaking in its execution. From strong game play, to likable and relateable characters, to an intense story and emotionally draining experience, this game defies expectations and becomes a new standard for the industry. I give it an extremely high 5/5, an experience unlike anything else and the ending will leave you speechless.,,Having waited several months to write this review, I have come to the conclusion that “The Last of Us” is one of the greatest games ever made. From a storytelling perspective, it is a game that is as revolutionary to the industry as Mario was for the very first time so long ago. Naughty Dog has made a game that is going to shift the way story is going to be handled in video games. Much like how many games after “Uncharted 2: Among Theives” released became more cinematic and like a Hollywood blockbuster, “The Last of Us” is going to make developers want to create a more intimate and a more emotional experience with characters that are well developed and relatable.",normal,ps3,2013-10-01,English,4,2,10,train

charmer,"First of all, I acknowledge the production values of Last of Us (LoU). Great graphics, check. Emotion-ladden story, check. Excellent voice acting, check. State of the art game mechanics, check. LoU has all that.,,But just as with Kane&Lynch, Uncharted, the new Tomb Raider or Bioshock Infinite, there’s a lot of fluff and eye candy around the edges but in essence the game mechanics require you to become a serial killer and pretend it’s no big deal at all. Unfortunately, this stereotype largely applies here too even though TLoU hides it a little better by pretending serious issues are at play.,,Even though gunning down droves of enemies has been kind of a standard in action games for a long time, the most recent ones, TLoU included, try very hard to make it look very realistic on the surface while insisting on cheap ambushes, predictable plot twists, and hordes of faceless foes just waiting to be slaughtered by the protagonists with very little option to prevent or avoid the conflict.,,I’m no longer sure what’s more absurd  that as a playing character you kill dozens of people in a row without getting killed yourself or losing your sanity or that your enemies keep piling up despite your track record. If you really want to play a game where all these things are addressed in a truly serious way and with a very strong point delivered, try Spec Ops: the Line.,,And if you want to appreciate the production values and story of games such as TLoU without being bogged down by stereotypical and almost dehumanizing gameplay, I suggest watching movie walkthroughs that are becoming popular and contain only minimal gameplay while delivering the plot.,,In summary  TLoU has great production values but gameplay is sloppy and repetitive, thinly veiled by emotions, graphics, and voice acting. I don't recommend it to play but watching it as a few hours long movie might be a way to get the best out of it.",normal,ps3,2013-09-30,English,39,7,4,train

Sure, I get what's going on in the story, but it's all been said before, it's a zombie apocalypse, nothing special.,As for the characters, I hated them all, Joel was boring, Ellie was close to make me care about her, but didn't really pull at any of my heartstrings.,And now the part that gives the game such a low score: The ending.,Okay, after killing thousands of innocent people, Joel gets Ellie (who is immune to the virus) to the Fireflies (the people who are working on a cure), when he realizes that giving Ellie to the Fireflies will end up killing her for the sake of humanity, he grabs an assault rifle and kills everyone in the hospital, and when the leader of the Fireflies tries to make him reason, he pulls a pistol out nowhere and shoots her! Why?! When they give you plenty of choices during the game, why don't we get a choice here?! I wanted to save humanity, but nope, the developers tried their best to make an unappealing story for me.,And the very end is either a cliffhanger or doesn't make sense, because Joel asks Ellie to never speak of what happened, and end on Ellie saying ""yes"". So Joel got away with killing a bunch of innocent people? How stupid is that?!,While I can see why people like this game, it's just not for me, call me a hipster, but it won't change the fact that I think this game was only average.",normal,ps3,2013-09-22,English,7,1,5,test

ChrisF2112,"Easily one of the best games I have ever played. Naughty Dog has maintained it's firm lead as my favorite developer around. No spoilers, promise.,,The Last of Us is a post apocalyptic masterpiece. You play the game through the eyes of Joel, a hardened survivor who has seen too much for one person. Joel is not a hero and he's not a good person. He's simply a survivor. As you play through the game you will begin to relate with Joel and understand how he became the way he is. One of the greatest triumphs of this game is putting you in the survival first mindset.,,While secondary to the incredible story, cutscenes, and characterization, the gameplay of The Last of Us is fantastic. The game allows you the freedom to choose how to approach almost every engagement. The combat is gruesome and realistic, and only serves to engage you in the action more. The realism of choking an enemy to death reminds you that you are not just choking some random villain, this is just another person trying to survive. The game provides a fantastic illusion of existing in a real world, despite the fact that it is a linear game.,,I can't possibly end my review without mentioning the graphics. They are stunningly good. I did not think that current generation games would look any better than Uncharted 3, but they have improved their graphics again.

You get your canned little girl sidekick and I guess you are supposed to feel attached to her but she is a walking swearing stereotype.,This game makes very little sense overall. It plays like resident evil but the zombies are fast and can instantly kill you. I understand this is meant to create tension but it ends up being tedious. Navigating the environments is a chore as you wander around with no apparent direction and the only open path leads you to your destination. It feels very artificial.

I picked it up again last month and tried again and this time without any of the expectation i had last time i was completely drawn in to Joel and Ellie's world, it has got to be the must captivating game i have ever played, and i've been gaming for longer than most gamers have been alive! I loved the characters and the story, it was all quite believable, the game play was excellent, i loved how you could explore some sections without coming across another living think (though you expect something to jump out round every corner!). By the end i didn't want to stop playing. Sequel?

MAzing87,"This is my first review for metacritic. And there's no better game to start off with.,,If the Last of Us isn't game of the year, demand a recount. This is one of the most enjoyable games for the PS3. The story, although often rehashed with the premise of surviving a zombie ridden world, TLOU provides a great story. Joel, is paired up with Ellie, a young girl who seems to be the key to ending or at least surpress the spread of zombies. Ellie is immune, and a group called the Fireflies wants to get a hold of Ellie. That's all I'll say for now. The presentation or visuals, gritty, dark, perfect. You really get that feeling of wanting to survive. The sound, music fits right in with what's happening on screen, the voice acting is great. The clickers are as creepy as they look. I dare anyone to play this on their sound system at night, late night. The combat is where it shines. You are limited in ammunition and weapons in general. I really felt the need to move around and make sure my shots count. There's an excellent crafting system as well. You get to craft shivs), bombs, smoke bombs, and molotovs. The enemies, a rebel group of hunters, the aforementioned fireflies, and the zombies, which are called clickers. They come in different versions depending on how long someone has been infected. This might be my only real gripe about the game. There were many variations of clickers but I felt as if there should have been more. It's minor. Once you complete the game, you have the option to try it again on harder difficulties. I'm on new game plus.,,And then there's the online. This is a breath of fresh air! Warning, if you're a COD gamer, the online is not for you. The online is much slower paced and incorporates the crafting system found in the single player. Nicely done. Teamwork is the main key to the online. In one mode, supply raid, each team has 20 reinforcements or tickets. When a player dies, a reinforcement is used. The team that runs out of reinforcements loses. There's also a no supply raid (no respawn) mode and an interrogation mode. The downside is there are only 3 modes but there's much potential to have more. Interrogation was the new mode added recently.,,If you're looking for a great adventure/survival game, The Last of Us is the game to play.",normal,ps3,2013-09-18,English,1,0,9,train

While the gameplay has a few minor issues such as irrational AI patterns and sometimes intuitive cover systems, they never detract to the overall experience that is delivered. The Last of Us will allow you to embark on a journey, Ellie and Joel's journey, both the characters are delivered with surgical precision to the point that you become completely invested in the story and gameplay creating a whirlwind of higher emotions such as fear, despair, regret, guilt and infatuation. The gameplay is strategic through the element of stealth and strategy as well as adapting dynamic AI that react to your behavioral patterns and actually surprise, flank and catch you off guard, countering and forcing you to adapt, something few games are capable of.,,Summary,I would give the game a 9.8 with the few unpolished bugs holding it back from perfection, if the game seems like your style go for it.

Abnuggler,"This is an amazing game, If you could imagine a realistic post apocaliptic near future game where society as we know it is gone, and whatever happened is not farfetched like most recent zombie movies and games (you wont see any zombified weird boss creatures here). This game has a very ""The Walking dead"" meets ""I am Legend"" meets ""Mad Max"" (or ""The Book of Eli"") feel to it.,,The world as we know is gone and life continues to some degree; some places are ""safe"" but the outside world is full of danger, be it Infected Zombie like Humans o just plain Scavangers who kill other humans to stay alive.,,I haven't been this amazed by the how real everything in this game since GameCube's remake of Resident Evil, I know there nothing to compare from one to the other aside from biological zombies, and there have been many amazing games in between, but I remember how much I was amazed by RE when it came out for game cube, but The Last of Us gave me exactly the same feeling (only about 10 years later),,The game is quite realistic, it's hard to kill enemies specially with guns (unlike most games where enemies stand and wait to be killed), most character movements and story plots are very believable to the point where you could see that happening in real life in that particular scenario.,,My only complaint with this game if you can call it that is that it's not longer (and believe me, it's long enough) but by the end I wanted to keep playing, I wanted to know what happens next. I hope a sequel is done some time in the near future to give us more adventures with Joel and Ellie.,,Pick this game up for sure.

Fallenlords,"I bought a PS3 just to play this game, so it worked out one of the most expensive games that I have bought.  It is an amazing game, and worth buying a PS3 just to play.  If you like anything post-apocalyptic, this is a game for you.  As a game it's often hard to get the right balance of story and action.  So may times there is either too much repetitive action, or too many cut-scenes that drag on for ages when you want to be playing.  Overall Naught Dog to my mind got the perfect balance for that they deserve a 10 on it's own. But there are so many subtle things in the game that just have an immense impact, like not being able to pause in order to craft but having to craft in real-time.   The people struggle when you fight them, they don't go down easy.  Superb.,,The game also gets you to ask questions of yourself and ask who are the real monsters? A question that might seem black and white in a game about spore invested mutant zombie types.  But it's not that easy, the boundaries become blurred, and the ending... well that doesn't disappoint.

rhandstroker,"The biggest issue with this AAA title is that due to its heavy focus on story-telling that it forgets to be a game first and an interactive film second.  The game plays great and all but through out the whole campaign, it fails to go anywhere with it but rather keep players in a repetition of collecting items and shooting enemies.  Of course, the game offers a variety in ways you encounter enemies but not enough to keep its gameplay interesting.  It could have easily avoided such redundancy by introducing new gameplay mechanics or new enemies or boss encounters in the mid game to keep things fresh and make gameplay more engaging.  The whole campaign felt very flat.  The last section of gameplay felt very anti-climatic.  It was a bit more challenging than the rest of the game but it wasn't much different from what you were doing the entire time.   Stealth, kill, collect items, repeat over and over.  The online mode is nice but that won't save the main campaign from its mediocrity.,If they ever make a sequel, I hope they'll make a better game than a better interactive b-movie.",normal,ps3,2013-09-04,English,8,3,6,train

Condor,"9.7/10. A game being my favorite really just depends on my mood and what I want from a game at a given time, but right now, TLOU is my favorite game, bar none. The combat mechanics are a bit shaky, true, but I didn't buy this game and start playing it for a shoot-em-up style. The character writing is fantastic. The game is very linear but it doesn't feel that way, because you're often left to consider what you need to do next. The relationship between Joel and Ellie, and the world that they're traveling through, is beautiful. The storywriting and setting are stunning. I don't know what it is, but seeing civilization break down and become overgrown and largely back-to-nature once more is beautiful.,,And then there's Ellie. I wouldn't call it a character-crush, but rather almost a fatherly affection. She is living example that the state of affairs in the world doesn't ruin everyone; Ellie is basically untouched by what is happening around her, and you very much feel the need to protect her (and her innocence) and keep her safe. And it's quite sad, in a way, to watch her become more accustomed to the world. Not to mention, she (along with Joel of course) is quite well written.,,The game was short, and does not have much replay-ability, but I'm on my second playthrough simply because I enjoy walking around and seeing the setting so much.,,I understand that there are nitpicks about the gameplay that turn people off the game, and they're entitled to that, but I believe that the game was certainly worth its hype.

It understands what it is at it's heart and core, a game, and doesn't lack or overburden itself with unnecessary cut-scenes to tell it's story, allowing the players to truly live out their own experiences and their own viewpoints as they happen.,The balance of flow is nothing short of spot on when it comes to mixing gameplay with the overall story,  which never feels intrusive, unlike some other games that throw exposition at you, in attempting to make you care, when you probably don't give two ****'s.,Though not a ten out of ten, it is surely a 9.8, and a game deserving of the praise that it is getting.,Perhaps we have all been over-hyped out of our minds, but there is something special about this game I feel.

I see alot of people saying its overhyped, over rated and if it hadn't been Naughty Dogs game, it would have failed. Thousands of people can't be wrong. Its our job to build or crumble hype for a game, and if we are over hyping it, then make the connection. I hadn't even heard of this game until I spotted it in a shop, I had no preconceptions and the copy I purchased had no ratings or stars dictating how the game did. I went into it completely neutral. I was astonished. Its visually beautiful, unrivaled in my opinion. Its in game sequences and pre rendered cut scenes are stunning. The gameplay is tried and true, reminiscent of many games before, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4. But its the heavy controls and updated stealth mechanics that truly let the game shine. Its heart in your mouth, blood pumping adrenaline tension. Many developers rely on visuals and gameplay to drive a video game, often throwing a half hearted plot in for that little extra push. But The Last of Us is a heartfelt, movie style storyline. It moves you, scares you, and leaves you with a yearning for more. But perhaps the biggest part of this game that sells it, is the characters. Joel and Ellie. Their chemistry was amazing, both learning and growing off of each other. I had two problems with the games though. Something I like to call the unmovable Ellie. I was annoyed that in most parts if Ellie stood in a doorway you would be unable to move her. I was also frustrated by how any survivor you travel with makes alot of noise or even runs in front of the enemy and isn't even noticed. But as a whole this game is fantastic.

The cover system is also far superior to most, as it isn't a sticky system, and you can move in and out of cover seamlessly. As for the multiplayer, which most aren't even mentioning, is actually the high point of the game. If they were to add more modes, and 5v5 and 6v6 games, it would be one of the best this generation.

The story is one of the best stories ever (including literature, film, TV or what have you). I loved these characters: Joel is a complete phucking badass and Ellie earns your passion. The music, the graphics, the sound are mind-blowing. Every goddamn thing about this game screams perfection. Naughty Dog stepped away from their cartoonish Uncharted and Jak & Daxter and got my heart pumped and passion burning bright red. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! Either you go stealth or combat, it works out beautifully. It is one of the greatest games ever. Plain and simple.

Tokyochuchu,"The Last of Us is a REALLY difficult game to review. On one hand, it has hands down the best story, characterizations and acting I've ever come across in a game. It even puts the likes of Telltale's The Walking Dead to shame. The game makes you feel sad and angry at all the right moments. It is absolutely perfect in that regard and a new benchmark for gaming. That said, gameplay wise, The Last of Us often treads uneven ground. The game is very repetitive. You enter an area, kill or sneak past a finite amount of enemies and then escape that area via a ladder  wheely bin  garage door  floating pallet. Then you enter the next area and do exactly the same. Aside from aesthetic changes, there is almost no deviation in this routine. Why Joel and Ellie can seemingly always find a ladder or pallet whenever they need one is quite the mystery indeed. It kind of reminds me of the old Adam west Batman TV show, where the Bats had a repellent for every known situation ever developed (shark repellent  bear repellent  heterosexual repellent... etc). The sheer stupidity of that mechanic broke immersion many, many times. The combat is decent enough. The human enemy A.I is nice, with lots of flanking and cover tactics being employed. The stealthy monster takedowns feel very gamey and arena based but they're OK too. The difficulty can be pretty harsh at times. This was a game that I had to repeat many different sections of. It can get frustrating because the checkpoint system sends you right back to the start of the 'arena' you're in, sometimes deleting a fair amount of hard-fought progress. Overall, The Last of Us was a very memorable experience. There was far too much stupidity and frustration in the gameplay for it to be perfect but that story...

So when the time came for the ps3 I was beyond excited. But honestly there was never really anything that made me feel I needed to buy one. Not until Uncharted 3 which is when I decided to get one.  After that I didn't really know what to get other than old games I wanted to play but never did, but then there was The Last of Us. Not only is it a great game, but it makes you feel great to call yourself a gamer, Naughty Dog really know how to make a game that is thank you to their fans.

MikkoGV,"The Last of Us takes some of the most cliché gaming concepts (post-apocalyptic world caused by a virus, big mature guy protecting a little girl) and executes them in the best way possible. It creates the most heart-wrenching scenes which become more and more impactful as the story goes on and as the relationship between Joel and Ellie get stronger. Though often viewed as the protagonist, Joel doesn't seem much like one simply because of his actions and decisions, which is not often seen in games. It shows how far people are willing to go at a time like this. It brings out the best and the worst in people and to me, that is why this game is amazing.",normal,ps3,2013-08-20,English,3,2,10,train

JudgmentJay,"I had super high expectations for this game. I think anyone would with all the ridiculously high reviews it was getting from journalists/players alike. The prologue was a 10/10 no doubt. It was pretty standard zombie apocalypse fanfare, but it was so well-presented.,,After the prologue I was super hyped. Then the real game started. To sum it up I'd say it's super-generic stealth gameplay. There is nothing unique or innovative about it. It's been done a million times in other games. Now I'm not a fan of innovation for innovation's sake, but compared to the relatively high quality of the game's also somewhat generic but well-presented story, characters, dialogue, and voice acting, the gameplay sticks out like a sore thumb. To me it just wasn't fun. I found myself dreading the gameplay segments and wanting more story.,,If I were to rate TLoU on its story, characters, etc I'd give it an 8, maybe 8.5.

Narky,"The hardened survivor Joel must lead a young girl named Ellie across post-apocalyptic America. That is the bare bones of the amazing game known as the Last of Us. The game made by the astounding developer Naughty Dog. The story is pretty good, with two factions battling for control of America while an infectious fungus ravages America. It is well done, but not ground breaking. The game play is intense and brutal. You fight two types of enemies in the game: infected and humans. When fighting the infected, the game takes more of a survival horror. Without spoiling anything, I have a complaint about one of the enemies found later in the game. No, it's not because they were too hard, or too scary. They just felt like something that would be better put in a Left 4 Dead game rather than the Last of Us. Onto the Humans. The humans felt realistic and acted like would real survivors would react if the apocalypse really happened. Though, I felt a bit disappointed by them after watching the E3 Game play Video. It showed them more human and relate able due to more dialogue in the video. But despite this, they were very well put together. The A.I was very good for infected in my first play through. Game play overall was really good. But the star of the show is the characters. Don't expect any stereotypical characters in The Last of Us. All of them are well voice acted and believable. Especially Ellie, your potty mouthed companion.,In the end, The Last of Us is an amazing game with great characters and game play.

I was really excited for this game I decided to buy it for £31 on the PlayStation Store, not bad really. It starts off good with a strong storyline and decent characters (for a video game anyway) There are a lot of long cut scenes in the beginning which did annoy me. The game play starts off interesting for quite a while and makes you want to keep playing. It was around the time when I had to start transporting Ellie back from Marlene I noticed the game was getting repetitive and slow. The gun control is pretty shocking, the stealth that you need to us in almost every situation is almost non-existent and just doesn't work. I found myself literally replaying the same part more than 30 times and it seemed actually impossible at one point. The game starts getting really slow and just flat-out boring. Walk through all these random walkways/doors/stairs for 2 hours, get to your destination, repeat over and over.I would say the graphics are the best part of this game.

Rotate,"Upon buying this game from what little I'd seen, through not wanting to ruin anything for myself, I was more excited than I'd been for any game in a while. This, and only a few other games that I've played have put me in a position of ""Well, what do I do now?"" after I've completed it. What this game brings to the table is none-other than the greatest story ever told on console, maybe you could push that to ever in gaming, it is certainly the best story ever told to me. One of only two games that's ever made me shed tears and the only game that's ever made me genuinely care for a character's wellbeing as if it were a real person. From a storytelling standpoint, it's phenomenal. I would urge anyone out there who even has the slightest bit of interest to pick this game up immediately. The positions it puts you in with the people you're placed with is brilliant to say the least.,,The story sounds like something you've heard before, but that couldn't be further from the truth in reality. I can't quite put into words the significance of the story in this to someone who would be considering this purchase or playthrough. It may be because there's nothing immediate to compare it to in gaming? I don't know, but something about this game is just touching, emotionally and mentally. The tale forces you to think about what could happen to Ellie if this or that went wrong, what could happen to every little object in the world and every person and city in the wake of what has happened in the game. It can bring about sadness, complete and utter heartbreak right through to light giggles (Ellie's dialogue is riddled with them) to outright outbursts of game-pausing laughter (also, mainly due to Ellie's dialogue). It can bring about fear and terror and hype as Joel forces his way to getting what he wants when he wants it when it comes to Ellie safety, the relationship develops beautifully between Ellie and Joel in a father-daughter way. The game will at some point during your playthrough, bring about every emotion you know of, I guarantee it.,,From a technical standpoint, it's easily the best looking game on the PS3, a label that seems to come stuck to Naughty Dog like a watermark recently. The lighting is perfect, the textures are excellent and the motions, physics and mechanics in the gameplay are second to none. Voice acting is like something stripped out of a Pixar movie, a dark, morbid Pixar movie to put it awkwardly accurately. Gameplay is smooth and fluid, the gunplay and combat is polished and creative, the weapons you can create and customise/improve are simple and easy to follow, yet superbly detailed. The cutscenes are something you'd expect from a story-based game of this level, if I told you I was surprised by the motion-capture technology used in this game and the beauty of the cutscenes, I'd be lying. Just because I expected them, doesn't mean they don't amaze me. The world looks stunning as well alongside playing brilliantly, obstacles occasionally difficult to follow, yet it keeps the same mechanics so as to keep the gameplay familiar and non-too confusing, but you can make of this what you wish. Back to the main point, the world and the environments look amazing, sublimely crafted and thought up, aesthetically, it's perfect.,,The one gripe I have about the game on a serious note, is how the AI interacts with your partner(s). It doesn't, not when in sneaky-sneaky mode anyway. You could be hiding from Hunters, Runners, Clickers, Soldiers and all of a sudden, your buddy is standing in the middle of the hallway in plain sight of the bad guy, and yet they don't acknowledge their existence. While this doesn't happen often at all, it almost certainly will at some point. On a less serious gripe, the game ends too early and for me leaves too much out for me to be perfectly satisfied. You seem to jump from one place to another without taking into account this really important place that you'd have to go to first, places that could've been added to the story to add even more to the game. But then one could make the argument about whether this would make the game tedious and boring through having too much content in the game. But, that's just what I'd have liked to see.,,Overall, the game is perfect. I'm afraid to say that it's better than Red Dead Redemption or The Walking Dead, but for me, I think it's worthy of that title on a personal note.

In almost every encounter it is designed for you to clear the enemies out through silent moves, of course it is your choice whether you want to do this or go in all guns blazing, but there is one problem, ammo.  The player has next to no ammo in the game and what you will notice quickly is that you will be unable to pick fallen enemy weapons as soon as you have killed them.

I will admit the game isn't ""flawless"" it has some small bugs and glitches here and there but those can't and won't take you out of game and stop you from enjoying it. It has a pretty lengthy story, about 12-14 hours. Aside from that you have multiplayer. This multiplayer suits the game well, its tense, fun, and strategic. You pick a faction Hunter or Fireflies. Once you do that you embark on a 12 week adventure that has you trying to keep your clan safe and healthy. Occasionally there will be events that come up that have the chance to take out a certain percentage of your clan, it could vary from 25% to a brutal 100%.

However, that's not the case here. Supplies are scarce, as they should be, and getting past a room with infected/hunters takes skill and planning.

CNSavidge,"The Last Of Us Review By Charlie Savidge  CNSavidge,,Story,,The Last Of Us truly is a great game, its amazing, in fact  a masterpiece all of these words describe the graphically beautiful, but yet ugly grim reality that is portrayed in this game. And its not just another zombie game, here's why. In the game you take the place of a 20 year Survivor of The Bacterial Outbreak called Ophiocordyceps, named Joel. He use to be a normal every day person with a job and a family. But since the outbreak, his life has gone to hell. We then learn about what he is been doing for the past 20 Years. He has been smuggling goods to different parts of the quarantine zone past security to make a living. All government is gone, all there is, is martial law, the currency has been changed to rations, so that people that work harder get more things, but it isn't anything to care a lot about, this isn't a world worth living in. There is little to no hope in this world. But this is where we find the little hope there is. This being the second Main Protagonist in the story, Ellie. Ellie is different and full of hope even though all the people she knew died, she is still very optimistic.  She has morals but she doesn't know any better she never lived in the world we live in. All she knows is this world with the infected and living in a permanent quartine zone. There are moments where she questions what we did in our time that she finds Weird such as an Ice Cream Truck. Her interactions with Joel portray  them as having an almost Father Daughter relationship. And there side conversations make the characterization that much better. I'm not going to say much else to avoid spoilers, as it is an experience you will want to immerse yourself in. Because the story is important to this game, and the game portrays it in a way we can all relate to in ways such as death.,,Gameplay,,The Gameplay is Stellar, it lives up to expectations of a PS3 NaughtyDog Game. Apart from the One AI glitch I encountered, the AI seems very realistic. The humans care about their lives they hide behind cover when fired at. The more brutally you kill someone the more cautious they are about running up to you. As for the Infected will run at you just trying to kill you. The Infected stop feeling fear in their second stage. the third stage, the clicker is probably the most terrifying thing I've ever faced in a video game. If they get on you, you're done for good.  The horrifying noises the infected make really add to the immersion of the game. You use an abundance of weapons everything between a brick to a flamethrower, but ammo is scarce, forcing you to craft your own weapons, and your decisions can help or hurt you, choosing between a Molotov  or a health pack is just one of the vital choices the game forces you to make. And crafting in real time always has you feeling on edge. You can also upgrade your weapons at a work bench, also hard between choosing to upgrade your fire rate our add another gun holster.,,Online Multiplayer,,The Online is surprisingly great, you choose your load out and only get a few bullets and you find cases so you can craft weapons, like in the story. You can also buy armor,ammo, and guns in the menu waiting to respawn or in real time. The matches are 4V4 and the maps are large, stealth remains a huge factor. If you go in guns blazing you will die, even running shows you on the map. Personally this is one of my favorite multiplayers I've ever played, but it's just the icing to the cake to The Last Of Us's Story.,,The Verdict,,The Last Of Us is one of the best games I've ever played, and it will be for a long time to come. it has beautiful graphics, along with one of the best stories ever in video games, the story isn't just a story this game, the game presents itself in a realistic portrayal of things that we can all relate to and understand such as death and the love you have for family. With addicting gameplay and one of my favorite multiplayers I've ever played, this game is truly a Masterpiece and truly is one of the greatest games of all time. I give it a 10/10",normal,ps3,2013-08-13,English,2,2,10,test

JGogan,"This game is far above and beyond any video game you'll ever play concerning characters and story. This is without a doubt the best character-driven video game I've ever played and has such a fantastic story. Some people might not like the ending, as the choice Joel makes might go against players wishes, but in terms of a story that takes a turn we wouldn't expect, this is an instant classic in any game, or movie, for that matter. I truly developed an emotional bond for Joel and Ellie as this game progressed, the gameplay is spot on in terms of making me nervous about a future encounter with enemies, forcing me to prepare ahead rather than charge in guns blazing. In areas that are heavily infected with the zombie type enemies in the game, there's nothing more exhilarating than sneaking by an entire group of them and getting away with it for fear of not having enough ammo to take them on. This game will grip you from start to finish and arguably has the best story any video game has ever had.,,It's online multiplayer mode shouldn't be taken for granted either, as it is a warm departure from the typical shooter game being played online nowadays.

LogicalEagle123,"The Last of Us is simply one of the best games ever made. Do not listen to the hate you may have seen from Tom Chick from Quarter to Three (considering he gave Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 an 8/10) or in the YouTube comments calling it ""overrated"" and an ""interactive movie."" The Last of Us is a splendid journey that will take you around 18-20 hours with many scenes that will leave you speechless showing the worst humanity can do to each other. I can't say much about the campaign without spoiling it, but its certainly one of the best single player experiences one could ask for. This game is not an interactive movie. There is plenty of gameplay. The only gameplay flaws I can see are some bad AI that can break the immersion, but this only becomes an annoyance and doesn't ruin the experience in any way.,,The Last of Us also comes with a fulfilling multiplayer experience. Its in no way the focus and premises of the game, so if you buy games only for multiplayer, then go back to COD. Multiplayer is in no way perfect; but its unique and a challenge to master. Players must work together in order to survive and eliminate the other team. However, be warned, many players are a bit stupid. There have been plenty of instances where I am down and a teammate who is standing next to me clear as day lets me die. Be prepared for moments like this, help your team if you really want to win. One annoyance I found was the challenges. You have a population that you build up as you play multiplayer more that you need to feed and make sure stay healthy, but many times you'll be greeted with a challenge saying ""Get 3 Shiv kills or 100  of your population dies."" Its extremely annoying and you are greeted with it a lot, but in no way ruins this otherwise excellent multiplayer experience in this single player focused game.,,The Last of Us is a remarkable game on Naughty Dog's part, they have created maybe their best game yet. Any hate you find on this game are just trolls trying to get people angry or think everything needs to be open world and non-linear. The Last of Us is a linear experience, but its an excellent linear experience, it in no way holds your hand at all. A must own for anybody with a PS3.

Nerdlife11,"I will have to start out by saying that The Last of Us really does make the end of this Playstation 3 generation something to look back on how it started to where it is now.  Naughty Dog is the creator of the ""Uncharted"" series, and also many other big Playstation games. But the reason i bring the ""Uncharted""  series up is that ""Uncharted: Drake's Fortune"" was made in November 2007...one year after the PS3 release date in 2006.  So if you see how beautiful that game was in 2007 you can see in The Last of Us that Naughty Dog really knows how to push the PS3 to the limits graphics wise.  Don't get me wrong, graphics aren't the biggest thing about this game but the game sure does look beautiful and its unique that we get to see one developer at the start of a console's generation and at the end of it. That's not what this is about though, so just take that in as you play this game.,This game is a masterpiece by its design, story, and game play.  When this game was first revealed at E3 with just a teaser trailer I had so much hope for this game based on its post-apocalyptic world also with Naughty Dog as its developer.  Well I'm glad I did because the story I think is the best thing about this game because when you play as Joel for the first time in awhile in games you feel like the character, so whatever happens to him good or bad you feel as if its really happening.  The game is so emotional you may even forget it's a video game sometimes because it also seems like this summer's best movie at the box office.  As for the story, it's amazing but it's also amazing because you don't know what is going to happen and that is exactly why I can not tell you anything about the story.  For gameplay this game plays like Uncharted which isn't a bad thing but there are other features in this game Uncharted will never have.  There is a crafting system because throughout the game you will pick up items and you will need to use those items to craft weapons and med kits.  Also this game has different ways to play. You can be stealthy in some parts of the game, where someone else may run and gun. It depends on how much ammo you were able to come across.  For graphics it uses the PS3 to the max, it seems like, on everything possible. For now that is...,,Adam,http://www.nerdlife.org/about.html",normal,ps3,2013-08-09,English,3,1,10,train
ilovegames32,"Abandon hope all ye who shall enter here!! That's certainly the theme here and as  I'm concerned,its a good thing! The Last Of Us is made by the very talented team known as Naughty Dog and if your familiar with the uncharted series,you would only expect the best when it came storytelling and they DO NOT disappoint! So lets start off with the good points of this game shall we! Graphics: Incredible!! Naughty Dog pushes the ps3 to its limits,even out doing uncharted 3 with detailed area's beautiful water and smoke effects,fires,ruined buildings etc!! Sound: its average at best until you reach the clickers,their odd sounds will surely be unsettling when you enter  dark rooms or new area's. Game mechanics: average at best,controls are tight and responsive and the duck and cover mechanic is very similar to the uncharted series right down to the hand to hand combat but certain weapons like bats, 2 x 4's and shiv's make the fighting a tad more interesting. Story: again its a average at best as its your standard run of the mill zombie apocalypse story where your character must fight to survive who then,meets someone who's immune to the virus and must now create cure to save humanity....the last of us almost never treads new ground as many games and movie's has all too often shown us the dangers of a zombie apocalypse,so why is the last of us worth playing if my review sounds kinda negative save for the graphics? Easy, Joel and ellie!! Although they follow your typical, guy who lost his daughter and refuses to love another child/ ellie,who's your spunky yet average stereotype foul mouth lovable teen, I found it hard NOT to like them as they struggled to form a working relationship. This is where naughty dog took an average,by the numbers story and somehow turn it into a masterpiece! Now the bad points: Enemies: 100% of the time the enemies WILL NOT ATTACK whoever your with if they don't see you first!! It sucks the ""survival"" aspect and belief right out of  game and the player along with it for that matter which ruins the experience. Shiv's can only be used once(or three times if you have three) which i find odd,if you kill a clicker with a shiv( best option people) it magically disappears even when using it too unlock special doors filled with precious resources,but i guess they didn't want players spamming it.Ammo: while its not ABUNDANT its more than enough to get by on since joel has many weapons to use to dispatch his would be dispatchers like the bow,shotgun,sniper rifle,sawed off shotgun and about three hand guns,couple that with the (preferred)option  of stealth kills and your basically a god until you play with ellie who gets far less ammo and weapons. Other than those complaints,this average game goes far beyond the limits of other zombies apocalypse games and delivers something truly special. Pick this game up and add it to the list of impressive games that's exclusive to the ps3's library,you won't regret it! 9 out of 10",normal,ps3,2013-08-09,English,0,0,9,test
brianforbes,"What makes this not a great game  The controls are very unintuitive  any time I want to run, or use a medical kit, or just stop the character from crouching (which he seems to want to do all the time), I basically have to consult the manual. This is frustrating since the game is very focused on lots of action. Too much action, and too many enemies. Something like Silent Hill would have been great, just exploring creepy places, but this feels like I'm battling through a Die Hard movie.,These kinds of games, with lots of difficult action where you have to replay the same scene 10+ times, were fine for the 80s, but I had hoped we left those masochistic days behind us.

diehard-gamer,"Overall an excellent game. Everything is good. The story, the pacing, the set peices, the characters, the voce acting, the audio, the graphics, the combat system. Particularly good is the AI and combat system, which keeps the enemy challenging throughout the game. Having said that, there a a couple of really annoying bits that break the immersion. The first is melee weapons. All the melee weapons have limited uses. Does an iron pipe rally fall apart the 6th time you hit a zombie with it? The second is ammo. All your human enemies that are armed with ranged weapons will fire ammo like its going out of fashion. You will struggle to find every bullet. If you defeat a human enemy who has being firing continuously at you, you may find 2 or 3 bullets as loot IF you're lucky. So how come everyone has buckets of ammo except you? And where does it vanish to when they die? Finally if you find the M16 assault rifle  dont bother with it as its ludicrously undepowered compared to every other gun. Those are small points, but compared to, say skyrim, where NPCs carry the loot they carry into battle the one sided ammo bias does break the immersion.",normal,ps3,2013-08-08,English,3,1,10,test

Probably the best survival horror game since Resident Evil 4 for sure. The graphics are awesome, and you can see the emotion on Joel and Ellie's faces. The story is amazing, and kept me gripped the whole 12 hours.

Barrog1990,"There is something in The Last of Us that calls everyone´s attention, and that called my own attention when I started playing as Sarah. The immersion level on this game is incredible. The animations on playable characters such as Joel or Ellie, the amazing graphics (for a console); this is perhaps the best-looking game I have ever played on a console, and I can´t wait for Naughty Dog´s release on the PS4. Voice acting is gorgeous and the game´s plot is just genius, mixing a post-apocalyptic setting with the super complex relation between Joel and Ellie. The protagonists´ character development is one of the best I have ever seen, and the ending is one of the most unexpected ones I have ever experienced in a game.,However, this game fails in being an actual GAME. Fight sequences are amazing the first couple of times. My first personal encounter with clickers was tremendously difficult to overcome and I had to replay it over and over again. But when you get used to the fighting gameplay and you familiarize with the not-so-good enemy AI, gameplay starts getting kind of repetitive. In my opinion, gameplay is one of the most important parts of a game.,Another problem I found was that enemy skins kept repeating themselves over and over again! I think I killed the same bandit like fifty times!! I couldn´t believe that a game where each room you enter tells you a story without saying a single word, didn´t have a wider variety of skins!!,I played the game just once, as I believe that replaying this game would ruin the amazing memory I have of the first gameplay. I played it in normal difficulty, knowing some people that had to change the difficulty to easy because it was too much for them. I couldn´t believe they had to do that!! Reaching the final chapters I was literally able to predict every single movement a clicker or a human would make. The game became so much easier... One of the things I love to see in games is a consistent challenge, never letting you master the game, as difficulty keeps increasing more and more. This was nonexistent in The Last of Us. Perhaps in a few months, after I have lent the game to all my friends, I will replay it on the hard difficulty.,Level design was excellent, plot was excellent, character and enemy design were GORGEOUS although repetitive, difficulty *meh...*, voice acting was incredible, gameplay was repetitive, top notch, high-quality violence everywhere (loved it).

katferguson,"Can I just briefly point out to all those unaware, this is NOT a zombie game  The Last of Us exceeded all of my expectations, high as they were, and I can only find an incredibly small amount of problems. For starters, any of the characters other than the one you are playing (Joel) can make as much noise as they would like and stand in the open and not attract attention from enemies, but when Joel sneezes it brings on a herd of infected/survivors. Other small things, like being allowed to pass through a door in the middle of a fight and not be followed, as if the enemy forgot you were there the moment you left the scene, or lack of any true brain-teasing puzzles kind of takes you out of the deep immersion you would be in at any other time. Other than that, I have to say the ambiance, combined with the stunning voice acting and truly amazing graphics of the game took my breath away.

It's deserving of a 7 or 8. It's miles away from being the game of the year, though, and it definitely is not the game of the generation.

AmirBadeanlo,"The Last of Us is what proved to me that video games are going exactly where I want them to go. This game concretes my argument that video games are not only the greatest interactive art form, or the greatest storytelling medium, but just the greatest art medium the world has to offer. It's a beautiful, emotionally agonizing, epic journey that is unmatched by an book I've read, painting I've seen, Movie I've watched and so forth. The strange thing about the game is that the experience isn't your experience; It's Joel and Ellie's. Even though this is true, you create a massive emotional investment in the characters and everything they're going through. The story is told so flawlessly. It takes special pieces of their journey together and tells these bits at the perfect pace. The world Naughty Dog created is beautiful, yet depressing. The struggles and emotional hits the characters take in this dog-eat-dog world are hidden under the the green, bright, beautiful streets and woods. The Last of Us only has 2 issues; One being that the gameplay becomes bland at points. So much that you might be relieved when it's time for a cutscene. The other is very average AI. The Last of Us, for me, not only defined this generation of video games, but is the culmination of everything video games have been building towards for the past 40+ years.

But Last of Us also delivers a great (and in some aspects in the context of male-focused games even women-empowering) story. You will almost certainly connect emotionally to the characters.,I played the game together with my brother, exchanging the controller regularly.

TFxCaliber,"I first bought his game two days ago and I think it's really good. However, the only things that ticked me off a little bit were the graphics and the really low amount of ammo per gun. Nonetheless, I do kinda think the low ammunitin ""issue""(in my opinion)is actually a good feature of the game, cause it motivates you to be really precise about your shots, which makes you seem like a hardcore killer. Another thing, Ellie is now becoming my favorite character in the game, because she has awesome killing skills which makes me remind her of Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass  also, I do feel a little funny saying this, but I'm getting kinda attracted to Ellie lol. Overall it's an awesome game! :D",normal,ps3,2013-08-05,English,0,0,9,train

But the way Naughty Dog designed the characters and their personalities and how they interact with each other is just  amazing! And the gameplay... borderline perfect.

From the creators of ""Uncharted"", ""Jak and Daxter"" and ""Crash Bandicoot"", Naughty Dog hits another grand slam with ""The Last of Us"". Without spoiling anything, I will say that the moment you start up the game, you instantly care about these characters. You will feel for them, cry with them, and laugh with them all the way through. The controls are solid for the most part. Sometimes I'd have a camera problem and the dark parts, even with a flashlight, was very hard to see anything and had me wandering around in darkness until I found where I had to go even on my second playthrough. But even with that in mind, ""The Last of Us"" gives what anyone could ever want in a game and stands for how gaming has evolved over time with rich stories and beautiful graphics.

George-roots,"I suppose you're going to wonder (I hope not rage) after I give this game a 9, well actually I give it a 9.5 as Naughty Dog have outdone themselves with The Last of Us, Keep in mind I still haven't played Bioshock Infinite yet (I know the story) but TLOS represents the best so far of 2013 and the first game that delivers a level of immersion, emotion and gameplay we haven't had for a long time.,,Not to ruin the Story, the Plot involves a breakout of spores from the unfictional fungi ""cordyceps"" that in this story have mutated to be able to infect humans, cut to 20 years later nature has taken back a lot of the cities and landscapes of America you'll traverse as Joel a man now in his 40's-50's who's lost large parts of his life to this epidemic. Joel's mission is to escort a young teenage girl Ellie across these wastelands in a tale that spans all four seasons (approx. one year duh XD), Unfortunately this also means coming across a lot of desperate people who are willing to do almost anything in means of ""survival""...,,That's as much as I'm willing to say without spoiling the ever expanding story and deeper sense of urgency, the areas in the game are superbly creepy and upsetting, many times you'll find yourself triggering inappropriate conversations with Ellie that do wonders in immersing you and building up personalities that do invest you deeply in caring how the situation will pan out for these characters.,,Looking after Ellie I found myself comparing it to the recent ""Walking Dead"" Telltale games, who do you find yourself caring more for Clementine or Ellie?, I suppose I decided I cared more for Clementine being a younger, more vulnerable person, however I preferred Ellie as she was all the more well developed (also given the fact she's older and well aware of the situation).,,That's an argument for fan boys and I suppose I wanted to throw in my two cents. :-),,The Music by Gustavo Santaolalla is superb and deeply planted into my mind as fresh as any memory I had while playing this game, It always shows up at the right time just to pull you in that little deeper. But getting to the gameplay aspects do you finally realize how deep Naughty Dogs efforts were, Improvisation is absolutely essential to survival, you'll get those all important tools to see you through depending on your level of skill at the game yet you'll always find yourself wanting more regardless how much or how little you have, it goes from part drama part adventure to even survival horror seamlessly and it never becomes overwhelming that you'll find the situation and areas you get put into over the top as say the recent Resident Evil games, Start in Africa, finish in a Volcano my Ass XD.,,My final thoughts on this game go to the terrific performances from Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson for captivating us so well throughout this story, Motion Capture is starting to really help blur the lines between Movies and Games, Sooner or later I believe that stories like The Last Of Us, will help define how we will view both mediums in terms of the word ""ART"" and dare I say ""Expression"".,,Final Verdict: I consider myself an avid gamer, no question I went out and bought a PS3 mostly just to play this game. Naughty Dog, I loved Crash Bandicoot as a kid, Uncharted held me over during the 2000's The Last of Us is your Masterpiece, to anyone yet to experience it's entirety I urge you to as soon as.

SkiT,"Let me start off by saying; this was not a 10/10 experience for me, hence the rating. I played through this on hard difficulty. Combat is a fairly large part of the game, and I couldn't enjoy it. It might be that I am not used to aiming with a stick. But its not just the gunplay I have problems with. The AI; your companions ofttimes runs into enemies, however, as long as you are in stealth, they are invisible to the enemy AI. The infected (even the ones that scream constantly) will hear you unless you sneak extremely slowly, humans don't hear your steps at all as long as you are crouched. Humans in cover knows you are aiming at them and will not uncover unless you look away. Even if you slay people (with endless ammo?) there are small chances of them dropping ANYTHING. There are too much to mention, and all these things makes many encounters annoying. But don't get me wrong, encounters can still be very enjoyable. If you manage to sneak past several guys unnoticed, or ""make every bullet count."",,The moments between the encounters is when this game really shines. It is incredibly well made; the world and environments are really detailed. This makes exploring a joy. The relationship between the main characters is not something you usually get served in a game. It's brilliant, and it the main reason this game is epic. Pay good attention to the story and it will reward you with some philosophical questions, worthy of your thoughts. But, it's brutal and unpredictable. I think some people might not like this. Don't expect a Hollywood flick with glitter and happy endings... Great atmosphere. Great animations. Great graphics. I've run out of things to say.",normal,ps3,2013-08-04,English,2,1,8,train
SonnyChris,"I finished playing this game yesterday and I can't stop thinking about how amazing it was playing through the story. First of all the story is brilliant, thrilling, exciting and even at times funny. The mechanics are extremely clever and makes the whole game-play much more realistic than what many people might be used to. Being depended on creating and upgrading different weapons by finding different tools and not to mention the interactions of the other characters makes it a overall a realistic gaming experience. The characters are genuine and likable  especially Ellie and Joel -which makes you hope the adventure between them never stops. The art design and the graphics really do make a rare realistic environment of what would happen to cities if the systems went down, by showing the true beauty of nature. It's a clever contrast between all of the horrifying stuff you go through and becomes a sort of reminder of what's good and ""human"". The soundtracks are flawless. I remember entering the ending credits without even noticing the credits because of the amazing soundtracks that just bombed me with nostalgia from the wonderful journey I just finished. The online multiplayer experience is quite unique but extremely risky that takes time to get used to. Still The Last of Us is truly amazing and it might not only be the best game of the year, but also one of the best games ever created. What are you waiting for? Go buy it now!",normal,ps3,2013-08-03,English,2,1,10,test
Natedrake1994,"Probably the best game I've ever played and arguably everything about this game shines. Naughty Dog have done it again. The Last Of Us has outstanding graphics, good gameplay, sound, and perfect voice acting. The whole game was like playing and watching a movie and I've really never heard better voice acting in a game before. You care so much about Ellie and Joel and there is much character development throughout the game. Supporting characters are very memorable too.,The graphics and environments are also drop-dead gorgeous, and more than once I had to stop and gaze at the view at the stunning scenery in many of the levels.,Gameplay-wise it's good and there are many ways to take out enemies, be it all-guns blazing or stealthily, depending on your available resources. A very minor niggle is that sometimes the AI of your companions can be imperfect: they're not really noticed by enemies for example but that doesn't falter from the combat. Speaking of which both the shooting mechanics and physical attacks are simple and very satisfying, and being able to upgrade weapons, collect items, and improve skills is a nice touch.,Overall, another glorious game from Naughty Dog that will be remembered for years to come.

coven,"After seeing some incredible scores here on metacritic, I decided to remove the dust from my PS3, which I haven't used for about 1.5 years and give this game a try.  And what can I say... best decision I made in a while. :-),,[WARNING: Spoilers ahead!^^] I'm quite happy that I didn't watch any trailers/videos/screenshot before and also completely ignored the box  dvd cover, because it led me (thinking I would go along with Joel and Sarah since this game was obviously about a man and a girl trying to survive in a post-zombie-apocalypse-scenario, as far as I could tell^^) to a complete state of shock, when Sarah died right at the beginning of the game.,,While recovering from this shock, the evolving story & brilliant cutscenes pulled me right into that game  more than I could ever have imagined. Even though some parts (gameplay, graphics, etc.) reminded me on other games and movies (I am Legend, The Walking Dead, Uncharted,...), The Last of Us was/is a really unique masterpiece, which made me absolutely feel with the characters and kept me thrilled for almost 24 hour straight. I've been almost as busy with hoping/thinking/fearing about things that possibly might happen to one of the characters, as with actually ""playing"" the game to progress in the story.,,And even though it's been two days already since I finished the game, I just can not let go... I'm still thinking about the ending, the whole story, the characters... and it's really absurd: Fot the whole game I thought that Ellie and Joel would both die in the end... or at least one of them... but although they survived, I'm not really happy. Sony somehow managed to make me love them and I want to see more from Joel & Ellie and their future story.

Faisal7,"This game had me so enthralled that I felt compelled to write a brief review. I have played many games in my life and I can honestly say this is the best. No game in my estimation has ever merged story, gameplay, environment, cinematics, and graphics so harmoniously than TLOU has done. I must say I entered this game with little to no knowledge of it beforehand except a trailer that caught my attention and really had no expectations other than it being like uncharted it had to be at least half way good.,,Let me tell you, you will never encounter a more engrossing intro than what this game has in store for you. It has all the excitement and tension to prepare you for the ride to come and hits you with an emotional blow that will leave you as wounded and in search of meaning as the protagonist. The game has a remarkable realness to it that has you very much intrigued throughout the game. It's loaded with intense, frightening encounters contrasted with slow subtle moments of reflection and exploration. The fighting mechanics are well crafted as well as all the survival tactics and the way the difficulty is engineered in the game you will have to make calculated and intelligent moves to proceed in the game instead of the usual run and gun with loads of ammo scenarios. Both the human and infected opponents present their own unique challenges which you have to adjust for and this is no exaggeration, the infected will frighten you especially if you turn off the listening mode, turn that off trust me. The environment is another selling point for this game, you can spend hours just looking at all the nuances of this desolate, hopeless, and ruined world, clamoring to find remnants of humanity, it's an experience just walking through the various backdrops. To cut things short and I can write pages on this game which I won't, I want to write on it's strongest point, the story and the way it both enhances the gameplay and vice versa. Behind this magnificent game, is one of the most beautiful stories told in any form of media. The story of humanity enduring and surviving despite the most dire of circumstances, when the whole world has gone to hell, two people significantly different from one another find themselves building one of the most loving relationships you will ever witness. In a world full of violence and corruption, love is the strongest force binding us together enabling us to endure and survive and this game brilliantly explores this emotion. Like a loved one, this game certainly has some minor issues but they do not detract from the greatness that is this game as a whole so I won't comment on them. I'm afraid of giving anything away about this game and I think this game is best played without knowing too much about it but then again I have played this game 3 times now with each time giving me satisfaction. I will end with this, this game will haunt you, not in the sense of horror, but in the sense that it will never leave you, it will stay with you, it's characters will forever leave an imprint on you and once you have completed this game and seen it's powerful outro, you will have a hard time saying goodbye.Not to reek of hyperbole The last of us will go down in history as one of the best artistic works of this generation. Many games have had great heroes but Joel and Ellie seem to be the most real therefore the most captivating and though the idea of flesh eating zombies is beyond reality, this remains one of the realest games I've ever played.

chicagopoetry,"I'm probably not that far into the game. I'm only in Lincoln High School trying to fight the first big boss. I can tell this game is going to be one I'll probably finish but already I know it's not the TEN everyone keeps raving about. OK, I'm into the main two characters, I feel the emotional bond growing, that's cool. But the zombie fighting is just frustrating and unrewarding. I finally have a shotgun and thank goodness because the pistols barely even stun anything and your lead pipes break after about eight hits. OK, since when does a lead pipe break precisely after eight hits? It's a lead pipe for crying out loud. You can slam it against concrete a million times and it wouldn't break. And you can't aim your weapons worth crap. This guy, for twenty years, has been surviving the zombie apocalypse and he still can't aim a stupid rifle, waving it all over the place as crazed zombies straight out of 28 Days Later come rushing at him? Really? And even with the shotgun, which you don't need to aim precisely, what does that help when five of them are rushing at you from all angles? So you fight, you die, you start over, you die, you start over, you die, and so forth until you are finally lucky enough to pick them all off not by any real strategy mind you, just because you got a little lucky. The scavenging is pretty boring. The workbenches are so far and few in-between it's pathetic. The crawling through hallways, climbing up ladders, running across planks gets old pretty quickly. And everything is so dark. You have to use your flashlight at least half the time and that actually gets a bit nauseating as if your swirling around on a carnival ride. So, although the graphics are way cool, and the characters are likeable, and the plot is engaging even if it's derivative, there's just too much senseless wandering around, searching for the limited scavenger items available, and extremely frustrating battles with things that will tear your neck out while you're trying to reload your stupid gun or switch guns which takes like ten seconds or heal which takes several seconds and the controls are so complicated it's extremely difficult to remember what buttons you are suppose to be pressing while a swarm of crazed zombies are rushing at you from all sides.

This could of been the fact that I may be a bad player and I played on ""Normal"" difficulty, but I don't think that is exactly the case.,The story was amazing and could not have been done better (apart from the ending which left me slightly agitated). The whole concept and the way it was executed by the whole team who worked on this game at Naughty Dog was fantastic.,,Due to specific combat mechanics that aren't under my favour I won't give this a 10/10 but apart from that, this game was amazing and is a must-have.",normal,ps3,2013-07-30,English,0,0,9,train

Gamerboy93,"There must be more games like this. The Last of Us is a rare game which focuses on both the story and the gameplay and manages to make both of them brilliant, this is one of the best games of the PS3 era.,,Story: The story is desperately sad in The Last Of Us. Society has fell apart due to a fungal illness which makes human beings become crazy and ferocious monsters. Joel is a middle aged man who has given up on humanity and murder is something that has become a normal days work to him. He then runs into a young girl named Ellie who he is tasked with taking care of and escorting her across the country to a group called the Fireflies. The story is powerful but sometimes cliched as it follows some of the same plot-lines as other post apocalyptic fiction but if it ain't broke don't fix it. The characters themselves are down to earth and are the most likeable and understanding characters I have ever seen in a video game and it is truly sad the game has to end sometime.,,Gameplay: The gameplay in The Last Of Us is realistic and makes you feel like you a lost in a world gone to hell. Not only must you be wary around the infected but also other human beings in a dog eat dog world where the word mercy falls onto deaf ears. The AI for the infected can be predictable but it fits with the story of the game, the human AI is different from that and will hunt you down if you are not careful. Ellie is never a hindrance to the player since enemies never try and attack her and this can break the immersion of the game at times but it is better than having to constantly look after her like Sheva/Ashley in the Resident Evil games. Ellie is helpful because not only does she help find supplies but she will also distract enemies or even attack them which can make a difference when it's just two of you against a whole group of survivors. The AI in total is some of the best I've seen in gaming with only a few occasions were they don't seem to know what they're doing. Supplies are scarce in the game and every encounter makes you think should I use this now or keep it for later? There is no hand holding when it comes to supplies, once you used anything then its gone and all you can hope is it you'll find a similar item later. Combat is brutal, every gun shot counts and can knock Joel off his feet if he's not careful and melee combat allows you to do finishing moves that will cause your enemies head to smack against the environment while his brain pops out.,,Graphics: the graphics are amazing sometimes you feel like you're watching a movie and every expression is visible on every characters face both during game-play and cutscenes making them seem very human. The enviroments are well detailed and allow you to explore and scavenge it to see if you can find anymore supplies.,,The Last Of Us is the closest to a perfect game I have ever played with just about everything done right in the game apart from at times clumsy enemy AI and a little bit of immersion breaking. The story may follow some zombie cliches but that doesn't make it bad in any sense. The Last Of Us is definitely one of the best games I have ever played and it is one that I will play for years to come.",normal,ps3,2013-07-29,English,6,5,9,train

Never have I cared more about characters than I did for Joel and Ellie.  The combat is great and while not perfect (sometimes the enemy AI doesn't see Ellie when it should, and sometimes it doesn't notice their dead comrades as soon as they should), the fact that you care so much about Joel and Ellie makes the combat so much more fun.,,The cutscenes are awesome and there's plenty of them in this game.  The weapons rpg system is good, you can choose to upgrade the weapons that are important to you and you have many customization options such as increasing the range, increasing the amount of bullets in the clip, increasing the power of the bullets, and increasing the firing rate.  You start the game with a simple gun and by the end of the game you'll have some powerful military grade weapons in your arsenal.,,The multiplayer is also real good.  You have two options, a team deathmatch or survivor mode.  Team deathmatch doesn't need an explanation and survivor mode is 5 or 6 rounds of last team standing.  If you're not awesome with shooters get ready to be pwned hard, they have some really good players that will make you feel like a nooblet.  If for some reason you don't like hearing people talk on the microphone there's an option to mute.,,The story in this game is so good, this game is so good that if you don't have a PS3 yet now is the perfect time to get one cheap just to play this game, and if you wait a few months for the PS4 release I bet you will find used PS3s cheap on Ebay and Amazon.

audtothepod,"I don't even know where to begin with this game... I've been an avid gamer for almost my entire life, and I consider myself quite fluent in the world of gaming. After beating this game, I can honestly say that it may take a spot in one of my top games of all time. At the bare minimum, it's one of the best games of this past decade. Over the past few years, I've played good games, but nothing compares to how well crafted The Last of Us is. Although the post apocalyptic trope is somewhat overused now a days, Naughty Dog has succeeded in using this theme to create a compelling, immersive, beautiful, story with The Last of Us. Although some game mechanics are somewhat faulty, I usually can forgive some misgivings for a good game and story, and all of this makes me completely forget the bad about this game (which really there isn't much). Naughty Dog created a story that does not glorify the main characters, but makes them human. Most games, movies, and TV create this sort of ""hero"" identity with their protagonist, which yes, you of course want to root for the main character, but at the same time we, as the audience, know that no one is perfect. I think this in itself was probably the most important facet of the game that made it so compelling, Joel and Ellie are VERY human. Naughty Dog brilliantly builds upon their relationship through the game to create not only a bond between the characters, but uses it as a catalyst for what ultimately happens at the end. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the ending of The Last of Us is definitely one of the most emotional, impactful, and compelling endings that I have ever played. This game will stick with me and I cannot help but think about how morally dense this game is.",normal,ps3,2013-07-28,English,1,1,10,train

sJagstang,"The Last of Us for PlayStation 3 is one of the defining video games of this generation, Naughty Dog once again shows that they are not only one of the best developers in the industry, but they also show with The Last of Us that they are some of the best storytellers period.,,The story is a dark, gritty and brutal journey of survival with the main characters Joel and Ellie, I'm not going to spoil anything about the game but rest assured this is a great story with some fantastic characters.,,The gameplay is a stealth/action survival game with horror elements, with both infected and human enemies that have very smart A.I. and are a challenge to fight, especially on higher difficulties. I think the ""Clicker"" Infected enemy is one of the best enemies in a video game, The sound they make can create a very tense atmosphere in the gameplay, the human enemies are just as fun to fight as they are very intelligent in how they try to take you out and how they try to find you when you are hidden.,,Just keep in mind that the game is very dark, very brutal and violent, If you do not like these type of things then you may want to consider whether the game will be your kind of experience.,,Overall The Last of Us is a fantastic experience that should not be missed, If you have a PS3 then you should most definitely pick this game up immediately, If you don't have a PS3 then this game is the definition of a system seller.",normal,ps3,2013-07-28,English,2,1,10,train
tarsus,"I'd like to start by saying that this is a phenomenal game and is very deserving of a 9/10 at least, if not 10/10. I'm definitely not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the best games I've ever played.,,This is one of the only games that I've seen that can evoke emotions through it's masterful use of dialogue and storytelling. Naughty Dog definitely took a risk with such an emotional introduction and it paid off. This game had me hooked from the beginning. The narrative takes a cliche idea and gives it a refreshing twist. The voice acting is some of the best I've seen in a game thus far, only being slightly beat out by Mass Effect 3. The characters are dynamic and clearly develop as the story progresses. The combat system is very fluid and easy to use for first time players of 3rd person shooters. The enemies are intelligent and actually do use tactics to try to make your life as hard as possible; a pleasant change from the common enemies in most shooters. The landscapes are beautiful and very detailed. Each location is set apart from the others with its own individual weather patterns and foliage, making it difficult to become bored with exploring each setting.,,The crafting/upgrade system could be a bit more complex since scavenging for supplies is such a large part of the game. The friendly AI is somewhat dodgy in that they are apparently not ever seen or heard by enemies when in stealth mode. This could be helpful in that it could cause much frustration if they were seen. I have not experienced any bugs that you may read about in other reviews. The ending left me somewhat unsatisfied, but rumors that it may become a series quickly relieved me.,,I'm usually not a fan of super hyped games, but I'm glad people talked me into getting this game. I would highly recommend buying this game if you have a PS3. If not, I would urge you to get a PS3 for the sole purpose of playing this game.

Nerusan,"I've always been a Sony guy but not everything Sony has done is great (check Motorstorm, Playstation All-Stars, and the original Killzone). This game is one that truly caught me off guard. I originally wrote it off as being Sony's attempt at cashing into the Survival Horror genre but this was not the case whatsoever. This is Naughty Dog's swan song for the PS3 and this current generation of consoles. Only a couple of games really come close to being this good in this generation. The story was amazing, the graphics are very impressive even for PS3, and the gameplay is perfect for this type of game. I get why this game gets a lot of criticism but it doesn't (and shouldn't) be compared to any other game. If Naughty Dog could surpass Uncharted 2, then they truly have limitless potential. 10/10",normal,ps3,2013-07-27,English,1,0,10,test
c0mmander,"Whilst some may find the 10/10 surrounding thus game hyperbole, and they are in some ways correct it is still very deserving of its 10 nonetheless. There are hundreds of other user reviews on here but what I want to deliver is my critique of the game and what despite this being a masterpiece could have had significant improvement.,,So The Last Of Us at first appears a typical post-apocalyptic zombie story with all the tropes to prove it, burning buildings, panic and quarantine zones. But at the heart of the story is something more profound a story that in its trope filled plot has a deeper vein that tells an altogether more important story than anything before it in this medium. It is a narrative that from its first 15 minute intro engrosses the player into the game and has you controlling events that would usually be relegated to the work of only the CG. These 15 minutes are poignant, poetic and thought provoking just as the final 15 minutes of the game are too this story is about humanity's decline from what once was and most of all the relationships that form in these situations, those who have never known anything outside of this 'dying' world. Though the word 'dying' might not quite fit. Building structures appear heavily damaged cars ravaged by nature and yet without spoiling the plot nature continues to live on past the remnants of humanity's previous luxuries.,,But whilst the story does all these things there are certain immersion breaking moments that can take you completely out of it in gameplay. The gameplay can at times feel frustrating with the occasional check point that spawns you right in the middle of combat being shot at or the loud footsteps of Ellie as you stealth kill a clicker. Whilst these aren't completely game breaking they are issues that could have been addressed. Of course the gameplay for the most part has some of the best survival gameplay of any game so far and there are certain areas in the game that are scarier than the last 3 RE games. This is survival as you craft together the items you need in real time, change weapons in real time and bandage yourself up in real time. The real time (seeing how many times I can say it in a couple of sentences!) elements are extremely effective and give a sense of panic as your pistol runs out of ammo and you need to switch gun but the enemy is coming straight at you, it means deep, tactical combat both in multiplayer and in single player as you find the right time to craft items or change weapons for certain situations.,,Another issue for some might be the pacing. The game is split into chapters which are then split into 4 distinct sections Autumn, Winter, Spring and Summer. However the first section of the game is undoubtedly the slowest. It starts off at an extremely fast pace with many plot elements but towards the middle of this initial section it might feel too slow for some despite being at a nice steady pace which allows for characterisation and development. From here on in the game picks up the pace in more short and distinct sections that allow the player to still explore but also throws in more unique situations for the player to deal with.,,Finally the AI from the game is a bit strange because although for the most part it is seemingly quite intelligent there are certain parts of the game where you will wonder why the AI performs a specific action, though these are rare they can be frustrating to see. Although hardly happening to me the friendly AI occasionally shot in sections when I wanted to stealth the enemies and it lead to disaster in a situation that could altogether have been avoided. Although again there was only two occurrences with this it is worth noting still. Also enemies will occasionally see a body and not even question its presence there and at other times are so smart they can deduct your position like they are using a GPS.,,In conclusion the Last Of Us then is a Masterpiece but not one without some issues as Uncharted, Mass Effect, Ocarina of time and other greats are not without their issues, The Last Of Us stands as one of the best games of the last 7 years (this console generation) and deserves its time at the top of the charts and its critical acclaim. It is a game which undoubtedly cements Naughty Dog as one of the best AAA development houses in the world, and one of the biggest assets Sony has acquired in the last decade.,,Gameplay  9.6,Sound  10,Story/Plot: 10,Lasting Appeal: 10,Presentation: 10,,Overall: 10/10 Masterpiece, If you have a PS3 you owe it to yourself to try this out even if it isn't your cup of tea!",normal,ps3,2013-07-27,English,1,0,10,train

Maurauder,"Let me begin by saying that this game deserves all the praise it has gotten. From the opening scene to the final credits, I was enthralled. The sheer emotional experience that The Last of Us achieves is unheard of, for me anyway, in the gaming industry. I have never cried during a movie, book or game, but I did during this game. The story is amazing, because every single character has a depth, a realism, to them, and I couldn't help but connect with. Not only did this game make me connect to the main characters, but it also resonated with the people that I fought. I remember, during the first fight against other people, I was sneaking around cover, and overheard a conversation that the enemy AI's were having. One of them was telling the other one about his little cousin that ran off to join the fireflies (a group searching for a cure), and ended by saying that he hoped that his cousin was OK, and that he would see him again. I had to go into that room and smash that man's head into a table, so I guess he will never see his cousin again. The game puts a weight on death that makes you feel remorse for a guy that was on screen for three minutes. The Last of Us has an amazing story, that is augmented by its extremely impressive graphics. Everything moves realistically, and looks amazing while it is. The environment is beautiful, and because of the bleak outlook, brings to mind a sadness for the destruction that brought humanity so low. Although the AI was a bit wonky in some sections, it does not detract from the game, and is not noticeable in the majority of combat. The combat is brutal, as anyone will say, and gives greatness to the multiplier. The tactical matches give as much tension as the main story does. Overall,  The Last of Us is an experience, one that cannot be passed up. I would suggest this game to anyone and everyone. The story is impeccable, it's the best movie I've ever played.

You can choose whether to be stealth or go straight up on combat. You can talk to Ellie while exploring the beautiful world and you can get more emotionally adapted to them.

You'd be forgiven for thinking this sounds like hyperbole, and trust me, I was sceptical too  but TLOU is one of the few games that genuinely lives up to its hype.,,First, there's the characters. Ellie is far and away the most well drawn AI companion you're likely to see this generation, and one you truly grow to care for. Joel is a perfect counterpart  grim and violent, but with a plethora of emotions lying beneath his gruff exterior, you may not agree with every decision he makes (particularly towards the game's end) but you completely understand the reasoning behind it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson have wonderful chemistry and did a wonderful job giving these characters life. Impressively, the gameplay not only matches the quality of the story but actually complements it. The combat is weighty and tense without feeling repetitive; this is a game which makes you feel every gunshot and every blow. Enemies struggle as you strangle the life from them, beg for their lives as you line up their head in your crosshairs  make no mistake, this game is dark. One particular enemy type  the Clickers  ranks as one of the most terrifying creatures I've had the misfortune of facing. But this darkness and violence never feels contrived or gratuitous  instead it feels necessary to the story, which is the game's strongest asset. Such is the strength of the narrative that you will be completely hooked right from the prologue. This comes to a head in the Winter section which, without giving anything away, is simply one of the most masterful game sequences I've ever experienced. If you ever plan to play this game, avoid spoilers at all costs  it's an experience which deserves to be played with as little prior knowledge as possible, and contains some of the most beautiful moments on PlayStation.,,This game will suck you in and not let go for its entire 14-18 hours.

I can't say it's bad, on contrary I think it is an advantage. Acting is fantastic, cinematic are fabulous and visuals  I would say if every game on Ps3 showed the same quality who would need ps4 for other 2 years. My only concern is a gameplay. it's a little bit repetitive on my taste. and personally I would prefer more humans opposing me as I am sick and tired of zombie-alike enemies in video games. But over all this is the game you should not miss on no circumstances if only you don't have a ps3 of course.",normal,ps3,2013-07-25,English,1,1,8,train
Bro_Vince,"This game IS over rated. I can't imagine all the perfect scores failed me  AGAIN. This used to be the most reliable site to find an honest review. I'm not sure what is going on, but maybe some reviewers jumped the gun on this one. Either that or because of the ""PERFECT SCORES"", I expected something worth being ""perfect"".... I was anticipating something epic. something that would blow my mind. Got to the end of the game, and never found what is so PERFECT about it... AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE DLC NOT BEING revealed what it is, It's just access to online game playing. Wish I'd never bought it. Already paid TOO MUCH for this short single player game. There is nothing perfect about this game, and it was actually disappointing at the very end. I think I just got bamboozled.",normal,ps3,2013-07-25,English,7,4,5,train
MissFelixia,as an exclusive cant rate it above 5. as a rule of a thumb an exclusive on console can never go above 5 especially 1 thats really brilliant. i wont praise a console specific exclusive like others do since i dont believe in exclusives. thankfully my money went elsewhere for a ps3 and this game. sorry sony you aren't getting my money for just 1 game. shouldve thought about porting it to pc if you wanted more money. just because they rival Microsoft doesn't mean it should be ps3 only,normal,ps3,2013-07-25,English,6,3,5,train

Hats off to Naughty Dog. The gameplay is well thought-out and the decisions you make will impact on the way you tackle enemies. The world you are in is just so devastating, and right from the opening you will be stunned at everything the game has to offer. Ellie is one of the best characters I have come across, and the way she grows and becomes more independent is fantastic.,,As well as the single player, the multiplayer is also a great experience.

Survivor117,"Let me start off straight, this game is so delightful and promises to give you joy. Troy Baker, who voiced Joel, has done an excellent job in giving the character much power. Same appreciation goes to Ashley Johnson who managed to voice a 14-year old girl who is so innocent in the beginning and then slowly becomes the star of the show. Then I'll have to praise the sound which is done so perfect. The clicking sound of the clickers, the footsteps and every sound which is possible to happen in real life too.,,Naughty Dog, creators of legendary franchises like Crash and Uncharted, didn't disappoint with the gameplay and story. I am not going to spoil the story but it's a well written story for a post-apocalyptic survival adventure. The relationship between Joel and Ellie is weak in the beginning and then slowly evolves into a relationship stronger than anything else. Under gameplay, I don't have words to describe. It is so fluid in terms of switching weapons, healing during combat and since it's a survival video game, crafting is very much necessary. Crafting a scissor into a melee weapon is so realistic and helpful killing the infected. Besides combat, you have stealth too. The developers have done an incredible job making this part of the game. Sneaking around the infected keeps your heartbeat high all the time. You enter Listen Mode which acts like seeing through wall but it's realistic in the way that the target's position is judged by their sound of their footsteps, their voice and the clicking sound of the clickers. Sometimes you can't locate the enemies/infected because they don't make any sound. The different types of the infected is smart and it's better you find them out when you play the game.,,You collect supplements to improve your skills and collect parts to improve your weapons in a bench. The brutal violence in this game is as close to God of War only you don't rip enemies apart but mashing their head into a table is so mature. Ellie is not only a girl who follows you all the time but helps you in combat too. During the first hours, she throws bricks and bottles at enemies to stun them and giving you a clear opportunity to finish them off. Ellie can be a trouble sometimes. She stands in your way while you are in cover and can spoil your stealth plan. This is nothing compared to the stealth mechanics.,,Overall, this game is a sure masterpiece. There is so much content in this game that gives an immerse experience which probably none game could have delivered before. It's a must buy for all PS3 owners and I guarantee that you will not regret buying the game. There is a Multiplayer mode and new game  for the people who wants to keep playing this game.",normal,ps3,2013-07-23,English,1,1,10,train

SAVAGEHENRY,"Well, while it may not be lengthy enough for some of us naughty dog fans, and may have some little niggling bugs here and there, this is a fine piece this. This wonderful, scary, empowering, and generally diamond in the polished diamond stage game. Thank God we are not existing in a time where publishers are afraid to create games that are different enough in their execution, while being similar enough to others to not totally drown and falter. Thank Christ we have SONY with giant gold plated platinum balls, creating real games in many different and interesting genres, instead of dude first person bro-fests. As you can see, I am very happy about this game. The best thing about the last of us is the fact that it is REAL-ISH, the deaths are god awful to experience. I had to shut the box off once because I saw death sequences too many times, and I was sickened. The art and design of the levels is top notch, while not over the top. Gun play is enjoyable.

DarthBullydog,"This was a really good game! A testimony to Naughty Dogs story telling ability. The story was engaging and I kept coming back for more. I did feel like it ended a little too quickly considering what had just happened in the story progression, but that is just a minor grip. Also another grip would be the hand to hand combat, it seem a little awkward. I didn't care for multiplayer, but i didn't buy this game for the multitplayer. There is one thing that i would complain about and that is immersion breaking elements. Specifically during the stealth sections when you are suppose to be quite and your comrades are running around, stomping there feet, and generally talking quite loud. It made me remember that I was playing a game and that really sucks, because the story kept sucking me in.   This game is good enough to make me over look those things and I would label it as a must buy for PS3 users at a discount purchase.",normal,ps3,2013-07-23,English,0,0,9,train
ryurahi,"Although the game does have repetitive gameplay here and there, the story and plot driven aspect of it is enough to completely overlook any sort of familiar ""already been done"" gameplay. The mechanics and physics of the game are flawless. The acting and character development is by far better than 99% of movies out there and the fact that you get to play as these characters is the cherry on top. If you're a fan of the Uncharted series, you will not be disappointed. But if you're a fan of Uncharted and looking for a completely different way to shoot your gun, you will be somewhat disappointed because that aspect of the game is somewhat similar between the two. The game isn't really about zombies or action, its how the characters develop and survive. The only thing that i can see most survival game enthusiasts would have a beef with is the fact that when you die in the game, u just redo the same scenario until you get it done. But even that wasn't a big concern to me because if you spend a good amount of stealth time killing and one zombie takes you out, you'd have to redo all your strats again.

DMDmaster,"This game is truly great, but does it warrant the $60? That really depends. Its definitely different than many of the other games that have come out this year and it will no doubt receive ""game of the year"" status. The game is very solid, with easy to learn mechanics that make it simple for anyone to pick up and play. The story is standard post zombie apocalypse fare and can be easily compared to games like resident evil. There is more of an emotional weight tied to the story and does have some truly touching, shocking, saddening and bittersweet moments. But the story isn't anything new and wont surprise everybody. The way its told and its emotionally driven moments are what make it stand out from the crowd. The graphics are stunning to say the least. There are moments where you are allowed to take a breather and simply admire the work Naughty Dog has put into each environment. Everything from dilapidated cities to snow covered forests and wide rivers, to sunlight vistas and etc. There's even one moment in particular that truly shows the graphical fidelity of the game. The enemies range from infected monsters, to other humans that want to kill you for whatever reason they have. You have to option to use stealth or to run  in guns a blazing, but  only if you have the resources to do so. Supplies are limited and you need to really ration out your items and make every bullet fired from your gun count. These elements make for some very intense shoot outs that can end with you having only 2 bullets left in your hand gun. The length of the game is very good. It took me about 12 hours to beat and that was mainly cause of the random difficulty spikes and the occasional cheap death. Other than that however, your game time might vary, especially if you stop to read every note and find every firefly pendant in the game. Re-playability comes in the form of a new game plus mode which allows you to replay the game on the same mode but with all of your upgrades and etc. If you're on the fence about buying this game, i'd rent it first and see if you like it. I did so and i beat it during my rental time; therefore, i wont buy it at its full retail price. I will wait for the price to drop. If third person shooters with survival horror elements is your thing or you simply want a brief introduction into the world of survival horror, then by all means buy this game.",normal,ps3,2013-07-22,English,1,1,8,train

DirtySnackage,"The Last of Us has been called many things. It has the titles of ""greatest game of the generation"", ""greatest ps3 exclusive"" and ""best zombie game"", in order from most, to least ridiculous. The Last of Us fails to push the boundaries of gaming in any way. Not only does it not push the boundaries, it ultimately fails in the execution of tried and true gameplay mechanics and story cliches that would seem so easy to replicate.,The story is almost completely throwaway when you see how many recycled events from other zombie movies/games The Last of Us has jumbled together, humiliatingly paling in comparison to Telltale's The Walking Dead. The gameplay, just as well, is nothing stellar, inventive, fresh, or any other word someone could come up with for ""good"". Shaky shooting (I know it was made this way to give realism), upgrade benches, scarce ammo, and the upside down shooting sequence call up much too many similarities with the Dead Space series to be coincidental. At least if you use the mechanics from another game, an attempt should be made to improve on the mechanics, which did not happen. On the same point as gameplay, the ""puzzling"" (I call it that because I have no other words it) is basically a slap to the face. Take this, put it here, take this, put it here. Random plank of wood lying right where you need it, random ladder right next to the truck you need to climb. These ""puzzling"" events are completely pointless and are a very tedious and cheap way to make the game longer. I understand the needs for the puzzles, though. After walking from battle arena to battle arena to battle arena, I would rather be doing anything than walking to another freaking battle arena. This is a horrible attempt to break up the tedious arenas, with tedious puzzles. That is it for gameplay, next is environments. While the graphics are great, the environments are bland, with nothing really sticking out. When I first saw the vine covered streets, I will admit, I was impressed. After seeing the same vine covered streets for ten hours? Not so much. Another problem with the environments is the cover. It seems like in every room there is a labyrinth of conveniently chest high cover. Next, is the technical aspect. As many have noted, the AI is horribly stupid. Enemies usually wait four or five seconds before shooting you, see dead bodies and do nothing, and walk out of cover. The friendly AI is no better. They will get in your way, and yes, they yell to you while clickers are around, and nothing happens. The last thing i will be talking about, and by FAR the biggest put off of the game for me, was Ellie. When you first get Ellie as a partner, she is annoying and rude, spewing out swear after swear to the point where it is mind numbing. Three hours later, she is still annoying and rude. And she has by far the most unrealistic reactions to death I have ever seen. Three disemboweled swat members? Meh. Boy I just talked to yesterday turned and tried to kill me? Okay. I know she grew up in the apocalypse, but her reaction when somebody dies should be more than ""oh, that guy died."",The Last of Us is a jumbled mess of story and gameplay ideas taken from other sources. It does nothing very good, but everything good enough to pull in the gamers with unmatched fanboy love for PS3 and Naughty Dog. Now I know what everyone is thinking, ""omg xbox fanboy rated down the game."" This is simply untrue. Think about it, if this game was made by a different developer, and was not an exclusive, it would be throwaway. But somehow all of the problems with the game were dismissed as ""nitpicking."" It goes to show how low of an opinion the gaming community has when such a cliched game as the Last of Us can even be called ""game of the year"" or ""best PS3 exclusive"" or even ""best zombie game"" while games like Bioshock Infinite, Metal Gear Solid 4, and The Walking Dead exist.,To end this overly long review, The Last of Us is by no means a bad game.

CrazyNed,"This title affected me like a slow burn. I expected it to be  at the very least  decent, based on Naughty Dog's recent history with the PS3. Then I played through the opening section and I was absolutely stunned at what they had done with this medium. As the game added thematic components, characters, tweaks in game-play, and set pieces throughout its 15-hour campaign, I must admit to some confusion on my part. Certain moments were jarring, some were poignant and just right, and others still seemed overtly familiar. As the hours continued on in life after I had finished the game, I came to realize what had happened: Naughty Dog was two steps ahead of me in every way possible, right from the beginning. It's one of those rare works of art where the more one speculates on the events that have taken place, the more all of these things make total sense and seem inseparable from the overall vision. On this basis alone, ""The Last of Us"" must be one of (if not THE) most unpredictable games I've ever played. The relationship between Joel and Elle is never contrived, never played up or squeezed tight for emotion, yet also never abandoned nor underdeveloped  it's one of the most realistic portrayals of a surrogate daughter/father scenario I've ever seen, anywhere in art. I honestly have no way to lengthily describe this game in any satisfying way, so here's some random appropriate adjectives: unflinching, brutal, heartfelt, passionate, understated, terrifying, complex, demanding, and, ultimately, masterful.

The story is so cleverly written and deals with many mature themes, and I don't think there's any game that has had be so emotionally hooked and shocked me so much with the choices the characters have to make. I'd go into more detail, but I wouldn't dare ruin this game for anyone. In fact, if you don't have a PS3, buy one just to experience this game. And on top of that  the gameplay is amazing. I heard in an interview the game was influenced by No Country For Old Men  and I get that now  it's not in the story but in the incredibly tense stealth/survival gameplay. I'm not joking, this is one of the best games I've played in my whole life, and I'd say the only PS3 game that it doesn't top is Metal Gear Solid 4  but that's just my opinion anyway. Get this game  play it before someone spoils it  because it's one of the most incredible experiences I've had with a game EVER. There are a few annoying things barely worth mentioning though  it's really awkward in the sections where you have to move things and the water sections are pretty annoying, and there are some bugs and glitches that still need patching out  but these are barely worth mentioning.

The story line is pretty awesome, my only complain was the ending (not going to give any spoilers) I personally did not fully agree with how the game ended but it makes sense overall so its not going to affect the score. I played through the game fully twice on Hard and Survivor and both times were equally as fun which is very rare to find in a game but as with Uncharted, Naughty Dog hit it out of the park. Now to the reason I didn't give it a perfect 10. While I do think the multiplayer has fun and great potential to be great I expected a ""horde"" mode or some sorta infected/zombie related situation but there is nothing.

BadCaseLaw,"I almost passed on The Last of Us  I had previously decided I was not going to by any more games until next generation to save money. Everyone kept talking about how great this game was however, and how good the story an characters were, and for me that is the main reason I game. From FF7 to Mass Effect to the Bioshock games (to name a few) I love games that tell a story and have interesting characters. So I decided to give The Last of Us a try  and am I ever glad I did.,,The Last of Us, as I am sure you have read elsewhere, is a masterpiece. It is a truly brilliant achievement in entertainment and should be experienced by as many people as possible. The thing is, to truly understand why so many people keep saying this you have to experience if for yourself. Nevertheless, this is a review so I will do my best to verbalize why I feel this way.,,Lets start with the story. The big picture is nothing we haven’t seen before to be honest  an outbreak, followed by infected and people are left trying to survive in the dystopic aftermath. It’s a brutal world, and in the opening scene Naughty Dog lets you know very quickly that they are not pulling any punches in this story  it’s not a nice place and anything can happen. This is one of the game’s masterstrokes  from the opening scene you as the gamer feel uneasy with the idea that anything can happen and you are almost tentative to get attached to characters because you have the feeling anyone can be killed at anytime.,,The Last of Us is not about the big picture so much as it is about the story of Joel and Ellie and their plight and the bond that forms out of necessity and genuine emotion. It is how this unfolds that makes this game special  they are the two most believable characters I have come across in gaming. Due to incredible voice acting and brilliant writing you can’t help but become emotionally invested. If something is important to Joel or Ellie it is important to you. One more than one occasion I found myself wanting to rush due to a sense of urgency that one of the characters had in the game. There were cut-scenes  that were so well done that when they would finish I would forget I was playing a game and wait for things to continue like a movie. To further drive the point   my wife, who is not generally interested in video games, started watching me play and couldn’t stop. There were nights if I was off work and she had to get up in the morning where I would have to stop playing so she would go to bed a decent time. She also made sure I waited until she was home before I would continue playing  it’s that captivating.,,Of course games are also about the game play and the game play in The Last of Us is excellent.  You can kill enemies a variety of ways, and there is something immensely satisfying about this. Whether it be sneaking up behind someone and driving a knife in their neck or throwing a Molotov and listening to screams of pain as several infected get caught in the blast  it never gets old. You can take a slow approach, or if you have the gear you can be more direct. Be careful though, this is a survival game and resources are in a limited supply making you evaluate the best way each encounter should be handled.,,The small things in The Last of Us and the attention to detail really stand out. Whether it be a background conversation, some small environmental detail or the facial expressions on the characters   it is all done well and adds to the ambiance. One thing I really liked about the game was how it rewards you for exploration. More often that not if you take the time to look around you are rewarded with collectibles, crafting supplies or parts for upgrading weapons. The game is also beautiful  as someone who spends a lot of time PC gaming I have grown jaded with the old consoles and find so many of the games to look dated…this was not the case with The Last of Us. I am not sure how Naughty Dog did it, but they must be squeezing every last ounce of power out of the PS3.,,The game is not perfect of course, nothing is. There were occasions in combat when I would land a clean head shot only to have an enemy shake it off. As well sometimes in combat I would try to stealth and party members would not get out of the way. There were also times that an NPC would start a conversation with me when they were not close so I could not hear what they were saying  as a result I found I had to have sub-titles on when I played as I did not want to miss anything. These are all minute next to the greatness of this game and easy to deal with as they are the exception, not the rule.,,The Last of Us is the best video game I have ever played and I have been playing games since Colecovision and Atari. While it may not take this mantle for you I can guarantee that the vast majority of players with love this game. Or at the very least respect and admire the work that Naughty Dog put in it.

Hupples,"A good game, but more flawed at the conceptual level than a Naughty Dog game should be and therefore disappointing. The AI teammates constantly ruin immersion when the player is trying to avoid enemies or perform a stealth attack because they are invisible to enemies. Naughty Dog had to do this to keep the AI from getting the player killed, but still be able to have an AI character for Joel to interact with. This is the main problem with the game. Another problem is the linear nature of the game and the complete lack of choices afforded to the player, but since this is a Naughty Dog game these aren't surprising or unexpected. There is also far too many encounters with bandits who shoot on sight. This wouldn't be a problem if the enemies dropped ammo more often, but most enemies with guns do not drop any ammunition at all which is nonsense.",normal,ps3,2013-07-19,English,5,2,7,test
Ed_Kel,"At the risk of sounding cliché, I feel I have no choice but to give this game a 10. The Last of Us is yet another masterpiece by Naughty Dog that cannot be overlooked by anyone whom 1) owns a PS3 and 2) enjoys a game rich in detail  both graphically and the story line.,,Story line  Naughty Dog has always had a knack for telling a good story and The Last of Us is no exception. Instead of other ""zombie-apocalypse"" games, it focuses more on Joel and Ellie's mission (no spoilers) than it does on the infected. It's refreshing to play a ""zombie"" game without having to fight off hoards of zombies all the time. In my opinion, this allows more depth in an otherwise stale and lackluster genre.,,Game play   Is what we expect from Naughty Dog. The controls are responsive and easy to use. Enemy AI can be a little hit and miss, especially with Ellie. When in stealth, she tends to wander off, sometimes running into the enemy, yet they never notice her unless they notice you. I can see why people write negatively about this flaw but in my opinion, I'd rather the enemy not react to an NPC (Ellie) than have my cover blown all of time. With that said, I doesn't happen often and in no way will hinder your experience. Otherwise, Naughty Dog delivered a very fluid experience here. It makes for a pretty awesome experience when a hunter runs after you, then duck and dives when you pull a gun  it gives you a realistic sense of combat, unlike anything I've seen in a game to date.,,Graphics  I won't spend much time here. The Last of Us is probably one of Naughty Dog's last productions for this console generation. It pushes the PS3 to its limits and rightfully so. This game is worth every painstakingly realistic detail that you will encounter. From water, both above and under; forestry; run-down towns and cities; no detail was overlooked.,,The Last of Us is a game that shouldn't be overlooked from any PS3 owner.

PiLLe,"Very nice, polished game, but to sum up what I didn't like for that high price tag:,,I already lowered my expectations a bit since I got a bit bored in Uncharted 3 but in terms of linearity and game play I got slightly bored again, i.e. not really stimulated by the game's mechanics.,,Unfortunately I could also predict most of the story plot (maybe because it follows some Hollywood rules and already known plots/surprises from other movies/games) and I only got surprised in one in-game situation which is quite bad. Maybe that's good story-telling style, but I prefer to be surprised both in plot and  more importantly  during game play.,,I went a bit into sleep mode while playing the game and I only ""woke up"" to hear the scripted dialogues and cutscenes. That's mainly because stealth and shootouts are still quite basic. Stealth is not really comparable to Hitman, Thief, or Dishonored (plus they are ""cheating"" a bit with instantly lethal enemies) and shooting felt a bit simpler than Uncharted (slightly unpolished sniping, mostly uninteresting enemy tactics  sometimes pretty weird when watching them in listen mode). Basically you solve each situation once and you know how to solve the game. There's no real ""easy to learn, hard to master"" or learning curve experience.,,In a few situations I had enemies that didn't react to me at all and I got on of the sidekicks to get stuck twice (had to reload the game to solve one of the overly simple puzzles).,So most of the time what kept me going was exploration, seeing what the sidekick(s) do or say, or watching the story to unfold.,,I think in hindsight I would basically have preferred to see two or three good movies with slightly better plot for that money... or bought a couple of cool Indy games.

What really sets it apart from the pack is how this game makes you feel. The spectrum of emotions I felt were unlike any other game I've played in my 25+ years of gaming, and marked the first time I stopped a game to check in with myself emotionally  (heart racing and on the verge of tears). I had no idea that a video game could evoke such an array of real emotions (along with having a blast). For this alone I will forever be a Naughty Dog junkie and purchase whatever they spit out.

Michaelb,"I don't think this is the absolute masterpiece game of this generation, but I do however believe that it is still an excellent game with a great story, gameplay, presentation and even multiplayer. The single player campaign contains probably developer Naughty Dog's best story they have ever produced. The characters Joel and Ellie are some of the most enjoyable, memorable and real in gaming. Everything in this world from the people to the environments to the weapons all feel real. It's obvious Naughty Dog put most of their time in making their world and characters as immersive and tangible as possible and they completely nail that aspect. The way people talk and interact, the open environment and the limitations on supplies just make this actually feel like a living and breathing world that could exist (not to mention that cordyceps which is the disease in the game actually exists). Easily the best part of the game is it's overall presentation with it's great story, solid script, superb characters, excellent voice acting, and an unmatched environments. The gameplay while not the highlight is still loads of fun. This game is absolutely brutal with excellent animations and sound effects to make each gun shot, punch, strangle, and melee weapon sound real and gritty. The crafting system works well and adds a layer of choice and strategy along with the nice variety of weapons. The game especially on higher difficulties completely limits your supplies, forcing you to play more defensively and since this is a survival game, that's the way it  should be. This isn't call of duty, you have to approach each situation with care, stealth, strategy and a choice. Do you want to use your precious amo on this group of infected for a generally easier time which  after doing so will allow you to scout for more supplies? or do you want to stealthily take down each one which can be more difficult but you'll preserve supplies and will be able scout the area for more supplies afterwards? or do you just want to bypass them completely at the cost of not being able to scout for supplies but you'll still keep what you have?  The choice is yours really. Lastly the multiplayer isn't anything amazing but it manages to implement the single player mechanics into multiplayer quite smoothly. There's a heavy emphasis on teamwork which I really like and the crafting system works really well here too. All in all I spent a lot of time on the multiplayer and probably will continue, but it certainly isn't the selling point of the game. So in the end the last is definitely one of the best games I played in a long time but its not the best. The overall texture pop ups get real glaring and I have come across a few glitches that don't break the game but certainly hinder the experience. But with that aside this is a must own game that offers one of the best stories, characters, and environments in gaming. Along with solid gameplay and multiplayer, The Last of Us is easily one of the Playstation's best games and should be in every self respecting gamer's collection.

Swimmingdog72,"The Last of Us was by far one of my personal most anticipated games of the entire year of 2013, besides SimCity, we all know how that went down. The story was put together and like many other people here on this forum I found the game's intro to be revolutionary for it was one of the first post-apocalyptic games to actually show the night of the apocalypse  Even so I give the game an 8/10 since honestly the experience didn't  wow me like some over games, I mean half the game your picking up ladders, rolling dumpsters or getting the stupid pallet for Ellie to jump on. These extremely repetitive scenes tended to kill the immersion since you could see the laziness of variety within the game. Apart from the repetitive ""bridge-crossing"" scenes the story was very well written,  the bonding that slowly formed between Joel and Ellie and the weird/interesting friends/foes they encountered along the way. Yet even so the ending did prove for me to be a disappointment, for ending a game with the line ""Okay."" felt like the game was unfinished or rushed to be finished since they could have taken that so much further given the circumstance leading up to the final line. Overall, this game would not make my top ten list and left me felling a bit let-down, yet this does not mean it was a bad game. The story of it was superb up until the end and the combat was satisfying apart from the occasional AI glitch.

Naughty Dog has crafted a vast, emotional, intense cinematic experience that you wouldn't get from any other game. Joel and Ellie are some of the most intriguing characters in recent history, also the most compelling. The universe we are inserted into is rife with peril, emotion, chaos, and beauty as you toil through the 10-12 hour campaign, playing as Joel accompanying a young girl named Ellie, whom must be protected. These are characters you invest it, and care about genuinely, and want to make it to the end. The enemies range from the Instant-Death bringing Clickers, among other infected creatures, but also human antagonists, some of which are quite demented and vile themselves, thus bring the emotional tone up even more. The Last of Us is also a gorgeous game, pushing the limits of Graphical Fidelity that we are accustomed too on the Playstation 3, and looking like a Next-Generation experience at most times. There is nothing else to be said on the game without delving into spoilers or mentioning things that you need to experience yourself, but simply put, The Last of Us is a genre defining title, a beautiful Swan Song to the PS3, a breathtaking, emotional experience, and most of all, a masterpiece.

I want to add that for the first couple of hours, there is a sentiment of been there done that. It's not boring by any means, and I'd argue that it's essential for the game's greatness, but you'll only see that about a third of the way into the game, at which point you'll appreciate the first few steps.,,People who endlessly complain about the state of videogaming should play The Last Of Us with an open mind and they'll see that there's some hope.

WinterEdit,"============,Start of review,============,,This game is one of the crown jewels of PlayStation 3, and in the PlayStation-franchise. Quite frankly, I believe it to be the greatest game I have ever played, and I have played some good games, such as BioShock and so on.,,Let's break down why it is so amazing, in my honest opinion, shall we? Wouldn't want to seem like giving opinions without reasoning. Alright.,,================,Game analysis,================,,Story: Most likely in the Top 3 of all-time game stories. I don't know that many story-based games, but it indeed equals games such as The Walking Dead (Telltale) in terms of story. It is up to the player that whether you prefer The Last of Us or TWD. Crucial plot points are certain to make you at least have wet eyes, if not shed tears at least in the first time you are playing.,,Characters: Greatest characters of any games I have played. The journey they go through, make you immersed of it. Especially certain optional conversations, dialogue, and the actions Ellie makes just make you want to protect her. Even if she was only a video game character. You can't be annoyed of Ellie, unless you have a specific reason to hate teenage girls. Because of that, plot points can sometimes even shock/mesmerize you, which hasn't occurred to me in any game before.,,Also the side characters you encounter during the game, make you feel like they actually were not side characters at all. They are just so well done.,,Gameplay: Hmh. This is a topic many people consider to be the weak link of The Last of Us. I think it is alright. Sure, there are bugs that can interfere with the immersion, but those bugs were practically non-existent for me. Unless you're trying to have the game bashed any means necessary, you will be entertained by the game mechanics.,,AI: This is something people are also curious about. And now, let me explain. The reason Friendly AI is not visible to enemies, is that you would be annoyed how you are seen for silly AI actions. It was a Naughty Dog decision to implement it invisible, because of the reason said earlier. Sure, they could make/have made it visible to enemies, but then everyone would be enraged on how they're seen due to companions.,,Stealth AI is pretty good. Seeing a Metal Gear Solid-veteran say in a site that it was good even on his scale, I guess that it's alright when it's not bugged. Combat AI is probably one of the best in there, likely surpassing games like Far Cry 3 or Arkham City. But that is just my opinion.,,Graphics: So, some people have claimed the graphics are not as good as in e.g. Uncharted 2-3? Perhaps. But there is a reason the graphics can be slightly downgraded  because everything is supposed to be left without care for 20 years. Just like from BioShock to BioShock 2, BioShock 2 had slightly more decayed/corrupted feel to it for a reason.,,Overall: The game is immersive, story is top-notch and probably one of the best of generation, graphics are so good that some of the older PS3's have been reported to crash sometimes, characters and their development are most likely the best in PS3 and the entire current-gen.,,If you like post-apocalyptic survival (horror  horror in brackets because horror feel isn't that often there) games with one of the best and fun characters of gaming as your Friendly AI companion, I suggest you get this game.,The bug reports you may have encountered do not happen that often, never happened to me and some of friends telling they have not experienced major game-breaking bugs either.,,================,Awards and such,================,10/10,Expectation for Spike VGA Game of the Year,Expectation for multiple GOTY Awards from different sites,Expectation for Character of the Year for Ellie,Personal award for Best Game of Generation,Personal award for Best Game of PlayStation Exclusives in entirety",normal,ps3,2013-07-14,English,8,6,10,train

LTG_McNugget,"The Last of Us is amazing. It gives you an emotional story about the growing father-daughter relationship between Ellie and Joel and also shows them grow through all of their ordeals. This game will make your heart race and sink not because of the action, but because of the unknown fate of the characters. The gameplay is similar to that of Uncharted which works really well in the controls department. While I was never ""scared"" of the infected in the game, I certainly felt threatened by them. The fights in the game can range from mildly boring or frustrating to intense dances between the player and the AI which can rival that the like of the Monster Hunter series. The music is superb. It fits perfectly with the game and sends chills down your spine every time you hear it. The graphics are some of the best not only on the PS3, but also of this generation, even rivaling some PC games. Your breath with be taken away as you look out at the abandoned cities, reclaimed by nature. The Last of Us is a game like no other. If you have the chance you must play this game. It is a milestone in not only consoles, but gaming as a whole showing that games can be as cinematic and emotionally impacting as Movies can.

SilentINU,"Yeah this game may not have the perfect and the funniest gameplay but it has a lot of challenge and you need a lot of strategy to beat this game. Some times it may be frustrating and your AI partners may be a pain in the ass for you but this game does everything it promises, a perfect crafted storyline, some good rpg elements and interesting weapons in a world of tension between infected, the military and the fireflies.,From the beginning to the end i got glued to the story because it was so interesting. It may not deliver so many action that Uncharted delivered but it delivers a even better story, rich environments and strong enemies that won't be forgotten in some time. If you played this game from the beginning to the end you'll find some bugs and minor errors in combat but you will ignore that all because you will also find one of the best stories of this generation and one of the best post-apocalyptic game ever. You won't regret it, if you have a PS3 you need to get this game, because there ain't much games that reach this high in terms of storytelling in this platform.,This is a must have for everyone that likes zombies, strategy and amazing and emotional stories.,One more thing. If you played the other Naughty Dogs games and you already know that this studio never let you down just get this game and watch for yourself.,,This is one of the best games i played and i won't forget it and i still need to play it to get all the stuff and don't forget the multiplayer that also is good.",normal,ps3,2013-07-14,English,0,0,9,test

The characters in this game are unbelievable well write and acted you can see the amount of time and dedication that Naughty dog used in creating these characters. Joel is a best way to describe it a survivor at the beginning of the game Joel is not a good guy but he is also not a bad guy he just does what he has to do to survive in this world of his however Joel seems to be more of a good guy throughout the game however we learn that he has done bad things in the past when Ellie asks Joel when they are fighting some bandits if he has ever been in a situation like this before or something along them lines i can't remember but Joel answers he has been on both sides. Then you got Ellie who was born after the out break who is also an amazing character who you as Joel feel the need to look out for but she is not dependent on Joel and shows how she can quite easily handle herself in combat.,,The game also looks amazing with graphics which i would be happy with on next gen consoles with amazing detail and instead of the classic abandoned decaying cities in zombie survival games we see a city that is very slowly being taken back by nature.,,So that is why i give a game a ten and if you buy this game you will not regret it seriously if you have a PS3 then get this game.",normal,ps3,2013-07-13,English,2,1,10,train

dmonee,"Recipe for one of the greatest games ever. 1part Resident Evil, 1 part Metal Gear Solid, 1 part Far Cry 3. These are the 3 games that came to mind when playing, ""The Last of Us"". Whomever was responsible for RE 5 and 6, should be ashamed of themselves after playing this game. This is how Survival horror should be done. I wouldn't be surprised if future developers copy the formula for this game. It is a thrilling roller coaster ride of feelings and emotions while playing. It is my first game in which the narrative actually made me uncomfortable during CG scenes. How the developers blended survival horror with stealth was genius. When enemies are alerted, the game actually sounds off with the same alert you hear when playing Metal Gear. It makes me wonder, if they had to liscense that from Konami. Ammo? Yes, there is ammo, and health kits, and craftable items. However, these items are scarce, and when you do come across them. BUCKLE UP!! because your going for a gut wrenching, intense ride of gameplay that you've never experienced. The Uncharted simuarities are here as well. The Graphics, cut scenes, and even some light platforming elements brought Uncharted to mind. The slight visual cues of where to go next we're a nice touch and typical of naughty dog games. My comparison to Far Cry 3 is small, but it was there. Every time you run into a group of enemies, there is a strategy you can formulate to take them all down in your most efficient way possible. Some encounters, you don't even have to fight if you choose the stealthiest path. Good luck with that. Why? because when you encounter your first  human enemy, you will be terrified. You will panic and probably try to Call of Duty them to death, and you will lose. Then you will have your first run in with an infected, and the same thing will happen. At some point you will hide behind cover for awhile and hope they just go away. But they won't. You will have to engage at some point and attempt to dispatch them, while your mouth fills with vomit from the constant stress and anxiety you will experience. There is down time. During these moments, things will appear tranquill and serene. You will ask questions of the world created by Naughty Dog. How can post apocolypto be some pretty and f'd up at the same time? After your nerves are racked, there will be moments of, ""why is the game prompting me to pick up this weapon?"" why is there unlimited ammo for a moment? ""OH! so you can kick my ass some more......"" End scene, and some down time before they mind F you some more.  Unbelieveable. Anyone that owns a PS3 should purchase this game. I personally loved it and hated it at the same time. I am not a fan of stealth games like Metal Gear, Splinter Cell and some of my worst moments of Assassins Creed games. It makes me want to go back and try those games again. I feel like i've just been sent to Survival Horror, Stealth bootcamp. The great part is, the game does a great job of building you up and ripping you down. In it's finale, you will have a variety of killing devices at you diposal. I guarantee you won't use them. Because the game sucks? NO!! because by the time you arrive at the finish line, it's crucibal, you will be a seasoned killing machine, that relys on cunning tactics and stealth to get through. You will feel empowered, like a predator stalking it's prey. Your enemies will fear you, and you will be numb with emotion. All the items in your inventory are there to tease the weak. Those that decide to Rambo their way through the end, will have missed out on what makes it great. Which is why the game punishes you for using that type of strategy. It can be done, but it will be a harder path. Those indaviduals that can stay calm and focus their emotions will get most of what this world is all about. It took me 2 weeks to beat this game. Partly because of my disdain for games like this and also becuase it terrified me. Anymore than 45- 60 min a sitting was all I could stomach. I was petrified of what was waiting for me around every corner. I thought this game was great. It was made for everybody and nobody at the same time. Most people play video games to have fun and let loose. This game is not fun. Not in the way that your used to anyway. Gamers that love this stuff, will......have fun...most of us will be all screwed up and distraught after playing. The thing is, this sort of game has been done before. Just not quite like this. It has a genre unto its own. The Last of Us really does reinvent the wheel to some extent. The reason why it messes with you, is because the experiences it delivers are new and fresh. The same infected zombie that freaked you in the early parts of the game, will still freak you out in the end. The game doesn't give you a chance to be comfortable with your surroundings.  Im giving it a ten only because it blew my mind. How could I not.

RiotSpectre,"I've beaten The Last of Us on normal and survivor difficulty and sunk about 10 hours into the multiplayer, so you could say I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game (and will continue to play it).,,The Last of Us is an incredible experience, and if the concept of the game at all interests you then it is worth a purchase. Here's what I loved:,,The story  It's good, really good. Yes, it has zombies and post-apocalypse tropes, but by the end the plot goes in a very unexpected and powerful direction. The weakest part of the game is unfortunately the first couple hours, after the prologue. It picks up the pace though, and the ending hit me like an emotional sucker punch. My first play through took about 16 hours,,,The graphics are superb. what really took me in however was the attention to detail. If you let this game suck you in, it will. Combat and the stealth aren't anything groundbreaking, but being out of ammo and trying to sneak around an agitated ""Clicker"" is appropriately terrifying. Voice acting was perfect and only one line of dialogue out of hundreds struck me as being a little cheesy. Music was top-notch. Multiplayer is truly unique and pretty fun to boot, though it may not keep you engaged for more than a few hours.,,I really wanted to give this game a ten, but a few issues kept me from doing so:,,1. Friendly AI can't be noticed by enemies, which didn't bother me so much. What DID bother me was when I was trying to stealth and my AI buddies decided to open fire for no discernible reason, making me get munched on and have to start over.,,2. Enemy AI has some issues. The infected functioned fine, but human enemies sometimes seemed to space out and stare at walls even after being alerted by gunshots or fallen buddies. One section of the midgame this seemed to occur frequently.,,3. I admittedly got tired of pushing dumpsters and moving around ladders.,,In conclusion, Joel is no Nathan Drake and you shouldn't expect the gameplay to be fast and fluid like Uncharted. Regardless, this game is without a doubt within the top ten I've ever played, and I've been playing for twenty years. Don't get put off by the idea of zombies, because you quickly realize they aren't the driving force behind this game.,,It may not appeal to every gamer, but Naughty Dog has crafted something special here.",normal,ps3,2013-07-12,English,0,0,9,train

jamess,"Naughty Dog has taken their years of  experience dating back to Crash Bandicoot, through Rachet and Clank, Resistence and Uncharted to create their masterpiece, The Last Of Us (Us  United States? sure, why not). Although not as revolutionary as games like LA Noire or Heavy Rain, The Last Of Us takes what has worked in the past, the visual tracking of Batman, the multi choice strategy of Uncharted, the ease of weapon maintenence from R & C and Resistence, and has refined them to create as damn close to a perfect game as I've played. Following Dead Island and the Walking Dead games, the idea of another ""zombie"" game sounded stale. But it's the execution that makes all the difference. When engaged in combat, the situations change, so its not just running errands and killing waves of enemies. At one instance, you may be holding off a pack of zombies in a siege type situation. Next you may be sharpshooting enemies to protect your partners. Mostly you be sneaking around, stealthily killing and/or setting up traps.

Arbitwah,This is why I will always own a PlayStation in my house. I am a pc gamer for the most part. This game felt just as good as a pc game. Didn't look as good but since the PS3 is limited so must be the game but that doesn't matter. Naughty Dog shows just how far they can push that limitation and still get an amazing looking game. I wish Naughty Dog would develop one game for the pc. They are always key to detail and love to do the most with what they have. As for the story. The Story for the most part is the best I have seen for a game. It has some cliche and predictable moments but so does every game or movie in this genre. AI interactions in the game are both good and bad. Sometimes they can be flawless and realistic while other times they will just be your mindless AI patrolling. But that element does sometimes make you get comfortable with a situation that you should be on high alert with. There was a few deaths I had were the AI had grabbed me from about 10 feet away. While annoying it just made me approach the situation differently and fixed the problem. I do give one tip to those of you who have not got it yet and are reading this review. Use ammo sparingly otherwise when you really need it. Its gone. Also thank you Naughty Dog for a great game.

You really feel the tension with each encounter. The tension doesnt stop there of course, the fact that you really have to preserve ammo and make every shot count is and awesome game design decision. It forces you to explore, and really use strategic approaches to every situation, do you take down every one using stealth, do you avoid the confrontation and sneak past them, or do you go gun blazing. Either way you choose you will have to play smart and keep all your weapons loaded at all times, a split second can really mean the difference between dying or surviving.,,So much more to say about this game, but I would have to write a 10 page essay for that, in short The Last Of Us is a game we only get once every generation, the quality of the story, gameplay and graphics are superb, if youre a fan of stealth, action, survival, story driven games, this is the one for you.",normal,ps3,2013-07-10,English,6,5,10,test

Rem,"The Last Of Us is not only one of the greatest Playstation 3 exclusives, but one of the greatest games of the year. As Naughty Dog continues their heritage for outstanding graphics and audio, they set a new benchmark with their new setting. However with this new setting comes a drawback: it feels too familiar. This may be its greatest weakness as even though the virus that sets this all up is intriguing it doesn't strike the same feeling as when you are not in Kansas. Also another drawback would be the sense of immersion. Majority of the time it's amazing, but NPCs not being detected even in the open, and they do stupid things at time. The gameplay is similar to the Uncharted series, but has improved. What The Last Of Us lacks in setpieces from Nathan Drake more than makes up for in emotions and character development.

Everything I say may be a bit subjective but I think that the game should have focus on other things like survival instead on walk and kill (which doesn't mean is a bad game) but overall I give it an 8 because what the game offers is very good and is certainly a game that everyone should try.",normal,ps3,2013-07-10,English,0,0,8,train

I will not be discussing the particulars of the story or game mechanics, both to avoid spoilers and to prevent this from turning into a term paper. While TLOU does manage to incorporate an average level of quality in each aspect, the game overall comes across as a dud, mainly because as I played this game I couldn't get rid of the overbearing sensation that I had already played this game's prequels and that each of these, either in their own way or as a whole, were much much better than this latest release:,,If you've played stealth-focused games such as Dishonored, Metal Gear, or Deus Ex you've already experienced far more advanced and enjoyable stealth mechanics.,,If you've played adventure-based games such as Far Cry or Bioshock you've once again enjoyed better battle and combat interface mechanics.,,If you've played puzzle-based games such as Prince of Persia or any other game that incorporates more than a ladder/plank combo...enough said.,,And by far the worst and most over-hyped category, the carbon copy mix of Zombie-Survival, Coming-Of-Age, with a dash of familial bonding, was the greatest disappointment for me, as most games I am willing to forgive almost all assuming the story can bridge the gap between a lack of mechanics and my enjoyment. In this case, for me, the gap was only widened.,,While I understand that all creations, particularly in the entertainment industry, rely and build upon previous ventures, the lack of creativity or any sign of originality in this game, to me, is unforgivable and undeserving of the seemingly fanboyish reviews it has received. This game is worth playing to kill some time or as an introduction to the genre if you are just entering the gaming scene, but in no way was it worth $60; wait for the GoTY edition it is almost certain to be developed into or borrow it from one of the multiple friends you have who have almost certainly already picked this up.",normal,ps3,2013-07-10,English,232,56,4,train

Sirfranco4,"The best game for the PS3, and one of the best games out there. It's simple immersion on everything just makes it wonderful. The story of the game is very rich; it's dark, unpredictable and best of all immersing. The game-play itself is one of the best, though it could have been improved at some points, it' easily on of the best. For example, characters don't interrupt you when you're sneaking, or doing that type of stuff. Talking about AI, the AI is not bad, while some might disagree, I think that in combat they act realistically, because when people are in plain combat, they don't think about anything else, that isn't survival. People in combat sometimes lose their head and do something stupid, and I think the game represented that very well in that aspect. So let's go with characters now, the protagonists of the game are deeply made in my opinion; They have a rich back-story, a good past, and the most important thing, a good story in the course of the game. The game also has good scenarios, deepening very much on the details of the maps and in some cases the AI of the people who live on those places. They feel alive. The difficulty of the game varies upon the way you are, because combating a dozen of zombies, is different than just a few of them, which applies for the armed enemies also. It can be very difficult in some places, while it can be a walk in the park in other situations. That's it for the campaign.,About the multiplayer, we can tell it's a good MP, like a mix of popular shooters, but improved in a lot of ways. The customization you can give to your character isn't the most biggest one, but I won't say it's small, cause it's not. You can customize your ""flag"" or logo, your clothing, your attributes and your weapons, all of this helping on the actual game-play. And that's it for most of the game, I think if YOU play it, you'll feel the same. This game is worthy of GOTY, and worthy of being remembered.",normal,ps3,2013-07-09,English,3,1,10,test

FantasyGameFan,"I finished the game on Hard, and it was absolutely fantastic, though since it was such a short amount of time for the main story (20 or so hours, when I'm accustomed to getting at least 40 hours out of RPG type games I pay such high amounts for) I normally would have only rated it an 8 or a 9. However, I just started a new game on Survivor, and it is even more glorious. Survivor mode is what earns this game the high reviews it has received and it is what is earning the 10 score from me.,,Survivor mode is a true gaming experience with reduced requirements of cognitive dissonance. I say this because lower level difficulties give you extremely useful but overpowered tools to get through the game. My biggest gripe with lower level difficulties is that you can essentially hear everything around you.,,Not so in Survivor mode! You CANNOT use echo-location to hear where your opponents are and how they are moving. This fact raises the tension through the roof and makes every single encounter an experience in and of itself. When you're in a room with 10 clickers and you cannot track their movements through superhuman hearing, the realism of the danger really digs itself in and you experience moments of sheer and utter panic at not knowing what is coming from around the corner at you, and this lack of an out forces you to plan your actions very carefully.,,I will list what I see as the PROS of this game and the CONS of this game in order to explain my exuberance at this piece of art.,,PROS,,-Immersive and believable post-apocalyptic world, with an extremely well-researched and developed backstory and framework.,- Stellar graphics, truly amazing, look around and in every single moment you will find yourself enjoying the view and the effort that was made to make the environment credible.,-Every single action taken regarding combat decisions is a battle in and of itself,-Extreme prejudice is required in order to survive from one encounter to the next,-The most excruciating gaming experience I ever encountered was when I ended an encounter and had to survive without enough medical supplies to last to get to the next encounter. This game forces you to think very hard about the consequence of every bullet used.,- The story is one of the best I've ever encountered in both literature and media of this nature. The intro is a real hook, and the emotional involvement and attachment that the player develops for the characters is bar none some of the most impressive character building ever. When the end comes there is a real connection to the choices that are made by the storytellers and a clear understanding for why the ending makes sense.,- The cinematic quality of the game: I love movies, and this game feels like you are playing the protagonist of a very long film.,,CONS,,- Cognitive dissonance heightened in lower difficulty levels,- As others have complained, the lack of a credible melee weapon is rather unfortunate. It makes no sense that the protagonist doesn't have a knife or machete or something that doesn't break after a couple of hits. Yes, melee weapons and upgrades are great, and yes it is another part of ensuring careful shepherding of resources, but it was still rather irksome.,- Ammo is really scarce, though your opponents seem to be able to blast you like crazy. Really concerning when you are killing soldiers and somehow they don't have any ammo for you to gather. This is both a pro and a con, as it raises tension and forces innovation in combat situations but is still super annoying.,- Lack of narrative choice  the story is extremely linear and though it is wonderfully told and the ending is truly incredible, I am still disappointed that choice wasn't calculated to make this a far more realistic game.,- Bugs, though not game-breaking, there are still some that are really bothersome if you encounter them (but easily fixed through going back to a checkpoint, though it gets annoying if you have to go back after 30 minutes of fighting your way through only to have to do it again).,- The absolute scarcity of some necessary materials,- No meaningful death: this is not a survival game but is instead a movie where you play the protagonist.,,I gave this score based solely on the primary game, though I'm sure the multi-player features are wonderful. Since this game is in absolutely no way whatsoever effected by multi-player (as opposed to, say, Dark Souls, where multi-player is fairly important), I won't review it here.,,All-in-all one of the best gaming experiences I've ever encountered, and I've been around the block a few times (started playing video games/computer games back in 1992 on pretty much every major system that has come out)",normal,ps3,2013-07-08,English,2,1,10,test

I don't think I've ever been more emotionally invested in a story than I was in this game, even on a second playthrough when I knew what was coming, it still got me right in the feels.,,As far as gameplay goes  don't expect call of duty. This is predominantly a stealth game, and this is where it shines  approaching each situation cautiously and planning your every move with the limited supplies you have is the way the game was meant to be played, and when you know you only have 3 bullets and 5 enemies to take out, things can get really tense as a slight slip up will leave you sprinting desparately for cover when you're spotted and bandits open fire, or you hear the dreaded screech of a stalker in the sewers beginning his charge.,,Live this game, invest yourself in it and you will love it.

WhosXIII,"This game really had proved me wrong when I had first played this game. My first thought on the game was ""Wow, this game has mad graphics"" but once you start this game, you will finish it. This game has lots to offer and to be honest has some minor problems but because i enjoyed this game so much i gave it a 10. I've read some of the other reviews and one thing I have to agree on is that there should have been more puzzle into the game. When I first figured out that we needed to use the bin or the ladder/plank I was amazed. Once you got further into the game you just knew that you had to find one of them to get over/across.,,One more thing that I personally believe would be the most amazing feature would be to control the way you speak to others. For example you have a couple of lines pre-made by Naughty Dog and you just select which one on how you think your character should talk to the person. If anyone wants to see what I mean, get the game 'The Walking Dead' probably one of the favourites too. All in all this was AMAZING.  thanks naughty dog!",normal,ps3,2013-07-08,English,2,1,10,train

Jadedghost2,"I went out and borrowed a friends PS3 just to play this game, and in the end I was not disappointed at all with the outcome. This game offers a very rich and powerful story which engages the players and makes keeps them going. Although, the main issue I had with this game was the lack of compelling gameplay. After finishing the game and reminiscing about what I had just played, it seemed to alternate between 3 main mechanics. Runners/Clicker encounters in mostly dark areas, Human encounters and the used way to often find a pallet and get Ellie across some water. Although the gameplay felt very lacking, the story and amazing voice acting was enough to keep me compelled all the way through.,,The next issue I had with the game were the bugs that were so out there, I was surprised they made it through Cert. Some of the issues I encountered were bodies randomly shooting up in the air after being dead for a few moments, scaring the crap out of me (which was kinda funny the first few times); there were some major issues with enemies clipping through objects, or passing right through them; then the major one which would break the immersion was when your allies would run into the open, right in front of an enemy while the player was sneaking through a section, and the enemy would not be alerted at all. I mean I could see this being extremely punishing if the enemies could be alerted by your companions, but at least it would be accurate.,,Besides those issues I enjoyed playing through the game and watching the amazing cutscenes. The issues I mentioned above are not nearly enough to persuade me into giving this game a bad rating. For players looking for maybe one of the richest story driven experiences seen on either console of this generation, I would defiantly recommend picking this game up.",normal,ps3,2013-07-08,English,0,0,8,test

Tamamo,"The last of us is an interesting game that strikes all the right notes from good music, to an interesting and famillar yet different story. The last of us is not zombies, and it's not about defeating them or anything generic that some people on here swear it is and hand out 0 or 1's. What makes The Last of Us great is its very real out take and sense of urgency the looming doom and gloom that comes from a world that is left in ruins. The infection is not viral and is not made up. It's a fungus, a real fungus found in the wild although incapable of infecting human species but can and doe affect insect in the forests. The story plays out as it's trying to accomplish one thing, chronicle the lore and struggles of the protagonist and his companion Ellie. The varying people they encounter and the state of what society has been reduced too are remainders of a world that is besieged by fear and the loom of death that gives us a psychological horror and the need to ""survive"". The combat found in the last of us an get repetitive but it's also very real, in the sense that one bite is game over. Ammo and items are found very scarcely and most of it must be crafted from the supplies squandered as you go along journey. There is no OMEGA 6 Anti Viral Agent Team Zeta elite trained special assassin here, nor should there be; with that sad the combat is stealth and a fight or flight orientation often forcing the players to play quitley and think before they make an action. All together it's playing a movie that you control, from the voice actors to the quality of the game (We must remember this is a 6 year old console that has 6 year old parts and limitations) is very good given what is available.,The game has you grow to appreciate the unique story of just a normal man and his companion attempting to make a living and maybe even find a future amongst a world of ruin and destruction.

nshrader,"This is one of those rare games that is worth the full $60 retail price.  The story mode is among the finest I have ever experienced. Each character is so well developed and if you find that you can't make a connection with the leads in the first couple of hours, don't stop playing.  Eventually you will grow a strong bond with Joel and Ellie as you take them across the desolated United States after a medical outbreak wipes out most of civilization.  The graphics are phenomenal and the voice acting is superb.  Most criticisms I have heard of this game are regarding the enemy AI, and the fact that your comrades will run into the sight of the enemy yet pass unnoticed.  My argument is that this game wouldn't work if the enemies noticed your allies and would turn into a frustrating mess.  Why would you want to worry about the stealth of a character that you can not control?  You have to suspend your beliefs a little. After all, it is a video game.  The campaign took me about 13 hours to complete on normal, and even after all that time I wanted more.  Thankfully there is a decent online multiplayer mode to accompany the story.

During certain portions of play, this gamer witnessed enemies circling around nonsensically, waiting to be shot. Enemies ignore the noise made when Joel is strangling their comrades some 10 feet away. Allied AI also has the habit of running around everywhere, within enemy view, which they take no notice of. It all makes for a surreal and awkward passage of gameplay.

The multiplayer is also a lot of fun and something different than the norm. You choose one of two factions and battle it out for supplies to grow your own virtual faction and keep them alive.

Voice0fReason,"From the minute I started playing it, I puked rainbows for how beautiful the graphics are in this game. In the minutes before the official start of the game, I started crying for how sad it was (for reasons not in this review). The game play is incredible and difficult for the fact that you don't need to fight every battle which is exactly what I felt for the first time in this game. Yes, the friendly A.I. are seemingly invisible, but would you like it if they moved across on their own will and got eaten by the clicker? No, you wouldn't. It takes a little bit of realism out of it, but is that all that harmful. Food and water is another minor issue with the game. Overall, I know it was the survival game that is both graphically pleasing, difficult, and enjoyable with a great story to add to the experience. I did not mind spending 60 to get this game, it was well worth it.",normal,ps3,2013-07-06,English,2,1,10,train

Blackstep,"I've never felt compelled to write a review, but figured I'd make an exception for this game.,,First, just to clear the air a bit, I want to point out a few things the game is NOT.  It is not Uncharted with zombies, and similarly, it is not a shooter.  You can play it that way on the easy setting, and just shoot your way through, but on normal and up be prepared to do some sneaking and running away.  It is not a casual, cheerful game.  It's depressing, dark, and sometimes walks the fine line between ""fun"" and ""tedious."",,Also, just to put it out there, a lot of the negative reviews are by people who clearly haven't played the game, but have just watched a few gameplay clips.  Anyone who primarily complains about the game's ""puzzles"" clearly has just watched a clip but not played the full game; those sequences are a tiny fraction of the overall gameplay.  The game is not full of QTEs, but it might look like it does to someone who hasn't played it, as it will tell you which button does what in certain situations.  If someone complains that the game is just a shooter, take it with a huge pile of salt or assume that they played it on the easiest setting and just ran through the levels.,,So what is the game?  IMO it's primarily a stealth game, but in several instances it forces you to fight your way out.  But you're almost always outnumbered and you usually don't have a full supply of ammo.  If you don't like stealth games, you're probably better off steering clear of the game or renting it.  If you try to run in guns blazing, in most cases you'll be outgunned quickly, and if you manage to survive, you run out of ammo before you kill all the enemies.  What typically happened for me was that I would take down a few enemies silently before I got spotted, then would fight my way through the rest once they saw me.,,The basic mechanic of the game is cover based stealth; hide behind stuff, and make sure the enemies don't have line of sight.  You have a ""listen mode"" which basically lets you see through walls if the enemy is making noise, so you can keep track of them.  If you catch them unaware, you can take them down with a long strangle move or with a shiv (if you have one).  If they see you, you can still take them down, but it will alert other enemies nearby.  Also, Joel is generally not a very good shot as his arm wobbles, so its in your best interest not to rely on shooting (at least until you can upgrade).,,The story and characters are what drives the game, both figuratively and literally.  I can't say much without spoiling it, but if you don't care about the characters, you probably won't enjoy the game.  The tone of the game is oppressive and depressing, and thoughout the game I had a sinking feeling that something horrible was about to happen.  And sometimes it did happen.  There are few bright spots in the game.  This unending depression makes it hard to move forward in the game and at times makes it hard to play.  But the characters and their story motivated me to keep going.  If you don't like the characters (or don't pay attention) you may reach a point where you just don't want to play anymore.  Especially since some parts of the game are really difficult.  IMO the overall story is worth the effort, and the overall pay off I think is comparable to completing Demon's Souls and/or Dark Souls without spoilers.,,I did have a few problems with the game that prevent it from getting a 10 from me though.  The AI is really spotty and inconsistent.  Infected are pretty dumb in general, and I can accept that; some of them don't even have brains anymore.  But human enemies vary wildly; sometimes they're really smart, sometimes they're dumb as bricks.  Friendlies are similarly inconsistent, and on top of that, are totally invisible to enemies.  I can understand that from a gameplay perspective, but it can really disrupt immersion.,,Speaking of immersion, the overall mood and tone gets disrupted by the game elements.  Getting chased by a horde of zombies, but see something glimmering in the corner?  Of course you have to take the detour to grab it.  Someone tells you to go as fast as you can straight down a corridor, but you see a room off to the side?  Of course you have to go in and look for stuff.  Of course, there's the typical ""you're about to run into an enemy, so here's some ammo just in case"" loot caches in a few spots.,,Overall, it's an amazing game, if you buy into the characters.  The cons are pretty minor in the scheme of the game; the AI is generally smart enough to kill you repeatedly and its ultimately a video game so there are going to be gamey elements.",normal,ps3,2013-07-06,English,6,5,9,train

It's a masterpiece, a work of art, Naughty Dog's magnum opus, and it lives up to all of the hype it's garnered.  The story and graphics overshadow the games from the previous months of this year.  It's gameplay and combat feel gritty and real, with blood spattering with each impact of blunt force or bullet.  The connection between Joel, the games protagonist, and Ellie, the deuteragonist, are the pith of the game's story.  Their appearances and dispositions contrast sharply in the beginning but they begin to bond with the months and the few serene moments they spend together.,,The multiplayer is unique and hard to get into at first, but after a couple of hours I've been playing it constantly.

ChrisOzzie,"This game singlehandedly glued me back to my PS3.  So far, the great games of 2013 like Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite found its way into my Steam library on my PC, but exclusives like The Last of Us is what keeps me going back to my PS3.  This new release from Naughty Dog features mind-blowing graphics that somehow took advantage of the PS3’s dated hardware and provides smooth performance and framerates without any screen tearing.  The storytelling and characters was done so freakin’ perfectly, I don’t even know where to start.  Some characters, like Ellie, I just adored, while I truly despised the military and the hunters.  More importantly, the actual relationships that develop between characters left me captivated with Naughty Dog’s ability to portray characters reacting and cooperating with one another during moments of extreme crisis.  At no point throughout the entire 15+ hour campaign did my interest in the characters diminish.  In fact, the pacing of the story was so flawless, I actually grew more and more interested in the characters as I progressed further into the game.  The voice acting had the quality of a high budget Hollywood film, and cut scenes featured lifelike animations, giving me the impression that I was watching a movie.  I’m not sure if The Last of Us has the best story *ever* in a video game.  CD Projekt’s The Witcher franchise or Bioware’s Mass Effect series have impressed me more with their incredible background stories and game worlds, but no game can compete with The Last of Us’ cinematic presentation of its story and character development.,,The Last of Us features a hybrid formula of gameplay with new creative ideas in addition to some old gaming elements that I’ve missed from classic games.  In The Last of Us, you won’t regenerate your health over time like you normally would in other shooting games, and the various gadgets that you can craft allows you to use your imagination when engaging a group of hostiles. You could stealth kill a couple enemies, bait the rest into a confined area from the sound of a tossed bottle and have a nail bomb waiting to greet them.  Or perhaps you’re low on supplies and will have to manage by tossing that bottle at an enemy and race towards your dazed target to use him as a human shield while gunning down the rest of your foes.  The Last of Us offers incredible replay value with its new game plus feature.  There are around 10 upgradable weapons, 7 different skills and a dozen training manuals that carry over into NG+.  You’ll feel like a juggernaut once everything’s maxed out and will have a ton of fun adventuring through future playthroughs with all your previous equipment and collectibles.  The Last of Us features the best gameplay Naughty Dog has offered yet.,,Naughty Dog has no limits when it comes to creativity.  The Last of Us will have other developers quaking at the prospect to match the quality of this masterpiece.  I had very high and unrealistic expectations for this new release, and I *still* got what I expected and more.  The Last of Us induced emotional reactions from me that few Hollywood movies have accomplished.  The Witcher 2 will most likely remain as my favorite game of all time, but I’ve never been immersed into a video game this much since The Witcher 2’s release back in mid-2011.  From a climactic cut scene making me shed a tear to laughing at Ellie’s silly joke book, The Last of Us has given me an unforgettable gaming experience and won me over for game of the year for 2013.  This was, by far, the most gratifying 60 dollars I’ve spent in a long, long time.",normal,ps3,2013-07-05,English,1,0,10,train

RoboToxic,"Greeting's everyone, I would just like to start with saying the game is truly amazing, it really is. When you think about what must of gone into actually producing this game, it's unbelievable. And, they have done it very well, maybe the best out there in terms of production. But alas these AAA games come with a AAA cost, and there is the problem. Is a, more than likely, once play-through game really worth $60+tax? The average game play-through is around 10 hours and in terms of actual game-play mechanics we aren't being offered anything new.,,Despite that, I decided to pick it up. I am a game fanatic to put it lightly, and when I see a AAA game come out and get a metascore like this I can't help but have to give it a shot. Honestly I am burn out on the whole zombie apocalypse thing, but ultimately what did it in for me was when I heard the game was loosely based on the Novel/Movie The Road written by Cormac McCarthy which is hands down my favorite portrayal of an apocalyptic Earth.,,Well, I must say that I am very happy with the game overall. In fact, it is one of my favorite games right now, if not of all time (in the list of course hehe). But  besides what I think about the game and my ""feelings"", I would like to explain why I think the game is so well accepted and rated so highly. I am also going to do my best to avoid from any spoilers. This won't take long I promise.,,First, this game is essentially an interactive movie, of sorts. It isn't an FPS, nor an action adventure, but really more of a movie that you are a part of. In terms of accuracy, control responsiveness, camera angles, and overall character mobility the game is very much lacking. In fact, the game doesn't really offer anything new that you don't see in Uncharted, simple fact. Most development companies reuse game engines all the time, they just continually refine them and build on them eventually becoming the amazing things we see and love today. This is no exception, as you can easily find similarities between Uncharted and TLoU.,,Regardless of that, the game does offer many amazing things. Probably the strongest point being it's story and ability to make you feel immersed. Hell, I was almost in tears just by the intro. The game has done an amazing job at compelling the audience, it captures your attention and like any good movie or game, you become immersed in the illusion. And in that aspect it wins by leaps and bounds. Now, that's not to say the game is 100% like that, no. There are some parts that do seem a bit repetitive and game like. But in the end, as a whole the good far outweighs the bad. If you let a few small flaws interfere with your ability to see the larger picture then this game may not be for you, because it is not without it's flaws.,,My last point I will make is that the game also is the pitch perfect example of a well written and structured story. I think many games fail to capture the essence of proper story telling, where you carry out a structure of rules such as an opening, climax, closure, to name a few. When you structure your story based on these guidelines it helps to make the story more entertaining. Naughty Dogs nailed the structure spot on and I really believe that helped a lot.,,In the end, it really is up to the individual, and as I know there will always be those who don't agree with me so don't just take my word for it. Actually my advice would be, if you are unsure about rather or not you want to fork out the cash for it, go try Uncharted 3 and if you like that then I would definitely say get the game. Otherwise it may not be for you. If you liked Uncharted but your not sure if you liked it that much, just realize that this game is of much better quality, but still at it's core the same style.,,Anyways, my final score is a 9. Because, as much as I loved the game a 10 is a perfect score and the game is not perfect. My honest opinion, and to be more specific it's more of an 8.5 but I just rounded up  I know a lot of you would disagree either too low or too high, but hey it's just my humble opinion.,,Peace,RoboToxic",normal,ps3,2013-07-05,English,0,0,9,train
Blakfang,"Fantastic, emotional, tense. The Last of Us provides the opportunity for real immersion, provided you are willing to let yourself be sucked into the story and care for your characters. One of the main protagonists, Joel, provides the emotionally battered, steel wall figure, while Ellie challenges the armour he shrouds himself in. Cliché? Yes of course it is, but the voice acting and animation, while not necessarily the best that's ever been seen, especially given graphics produced on earlier technologies (see FFX cutscenes on PS2), provoke an emotional response and sense of attachment regardless. In terms of dark, gritty storytelling interspersed with feel good respite, this is one of the finest games I have ever played, and it's all thanks to the atmosphere.,However, before you rush out to buy this game, be warned! If you play games for gameplay, give this one a miss. Yes for the first hour or so the combat and stealth is very tense and trying, but once the limits of the AI have been revealed, the game descends into a fairly tedious exercise of stick and move, with even critical errors in judgement not being heavily punished. Survivor difficulty adds an extra layer of fun, however, with supplies being incredibly limited and the ""hearing"" x-ray ability being removed altogether, making the experience much more intense.,Some will live for the stealth gameplay, others will find this progress tedious and unfulfilling but thankfully the game provisions for both elements, thus aiding in reducing the tedium. Extras like notes and voice recordings add depth for those who, like me, enjoy immersing themselves into the story.,,Overall I'd have to say that while this game provides fairly average gameplay and a tired and cliché story, the execution of of both is fantastic. Better gameplay and a more original premise would have made this game truly unique and put it up among the timeless greats like FFVII and Silent Hill 2, but even so this is a hugely entertaining game and was for me a 10/10 experience.",normal,ps3,2013-07-05,English,3,0,7,train

And you do it over and over and over, when you are not shooting.,Shooting in this game is among the least enjoyable I've seen. Console shooting MUST have target assistance, even minor. Red Dead Redemption had it, Infamous had it, Borderlands had it. Their shooting is enjoyable. Last of Us is not. Moments when I had to pull my gun were the most painful experience in this game.,Stealth could be ok if you were the only character on screen. But when you sit behind cover and see your NPC companion running right in front of enemies and they don't see them... well, let's say, it breaks immersion.,Characters, aside from main two, are plain and their outcome is very predictable. And as for main ones, once you understand how this game works, you stop caring about main characters  you know nothing will happen to them. Creators were too obsessed about not hurting somebody's feelings to add decent amount of violence needed for this game, especially when it comes to Ellie, the underaged character.,The story was generic, you don't see any plot twists you don't expect. It takes very long time to get interesting, and when it finally starts to seem promising... credits. You see credits. The game ends. I swear, when I saw the final cutscene, I was 100% sure I'm about half done at most. And then  bang  credits.

The motion capture is AMAZING in this game!! In the first five minutes of the game I was already glued to my seat. Here is the storyline: Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what's left of the military. Despite the strict martial law, Joel operates in the black market of the city, smuggling contraband for the right price. Joel is asked by a dying friend to look after Ellie, a fourteen-year-old girl with courage beyond her years. What starts out as a simple job to deliver Ellie to another Quarantine Zone, soon transforms into a profound journey that will forever change Joel and Ellie. As they trek across a post-pandemic United States, Joel and Ellie will encounter different factions of survivors that have each found a unique way of dealing with the infected humans, the lack of supplies, and the threat of other survivors. As Joel and Ellie struggle to persevere, they must learn to trust each other and work together in order to survive the realities of this new world. At its core, The Last of Us is about the bond that forms between Joel and Ellie  it is the story of love, loyalty, and redemption.

DrahgoScribe,"STORY: The Last of Us is dark, intense, suspenseful, and at the most unexpected times... it's beautiful. Be warned this is not Uncharted, nor is it a standard zombie apocalypse story. The main narrative follows the relationship between Joel and Ellie, two of the most complex and fleshed-out characters you will ever encounter. From the start you will understand where they are coming from but over the course of the game you will form such a deep and profound connection with them that you will want to play it all over again. At it's core The Last of Us is a tale of survival and is constantly begging questions, tossing around morals and justifying causes, but it never feels forced, they want you to explore this topic and are letting you decide how you feel about it. This game somehow manages to find beauty in even the bleakest of moments, but I'm not talking about visuals yet, I'm talking about the unexpected moments that will make your heart wrench and your eyes water without overwhelming you with giant epiphanies. Bioshock Infinite, a game I also enjoyed, had moments where the plot was too much, where the twists and turns made your head ache, The Last of Us never does that though, instead it plays with your emotions, effectively drawing you deeper into the experience. This story has so many layers and dives into such profound issues that you will continue to gain appreciation. This is where many of the negative jabs come from, from those not mature or ready enough to handle the narrative it offers.,,GAMEPLAY: The way you can bash an enemy's face against a desk or blow the head off another survivor is undoubtably brutal and intense. This is definitely not a game for children and can have a strong impact on even the most prepared adult. There was not a life I took in this game that didn't feel real, every kill is felt, and every murder pushes you further on the edge of your couch. Ammo is scarce, as well as the supplies you need to collect to craft weapons, traps, and medical kits, making you feel truly desperate. There is no regenerative health, no ammo crates, no stores to buy upgrades, you must scavenge everything. With most enemy encounters you will have the option to stealthily take out your opponents, attack head-on, or occasionally sneak away. There are 2 basic enemy types, human and infected, human encounters are fierce, brutal, and desperate, while infected encounters are much more subtle, terrifying, and stealthy. What makes the gameplay so amazing though is the balance of everything, you never feel like a portion is too easy or too hard, too stealth-based or too combat-heavy, all of the upgrade systems coincide well and there are few weapons you won't have a need or desire to use.,,MULTIPLAYER: There is not a gamer in the world who doesn't get a little annoyed or put off by the fact that some story-heavy games put a focus on multiplayer. However usually multiplayer for games like this are just bland. Games like Tomb Raider, God of War Ascension, Bioshock 2, or even the Uncharted sequels, but The Last of Us just isn't like those. There are only two game modes to play, the one I prefer is called Survivors. It pits two teams of four against each other on a map where crates of supplies are scattered everywhere, they are essential to your survival as they contain scraps and parts used to make weapons and health kits, they are also very necessary because if you die, you die, and you don't re-spawn, you play until one team wins four rounds. It re-envokes that desperate feel I mentioned earlier when talking about the campaign, and to put matters worse your enemies are human, not AI, and they are just-as clever as you. Plus the multiplayer has an overarching meta-game where you are put in charge of a camp of survivors and must continue to provide food for them as your camp grows and as problems occur. The way this integrates with the matches is that parts you collect in matches from crates or players you kill goes towards getting food, plus you will occasionally be given challenges such as killing a certain number of enemies in a match to prevent sickness from breaking out in your clan. The larger your clan gets, the more upgrades to your weapons and character you receive.,,And yes everything else I haven't discussed is amazing, the graphics are easily the best of this console generation, the characters you encounter are awesome (TESS!!!), and the subtle, yet epic soundtrack. This is easily my favorite game of this generation and maybe my most favorite of all time, when rating games I never giver perfect scores but because this ranks so high, I can't help but reward a 10 out of 10.",normal,ps3,2013-07-04,English,3,1,10,train
scott182,"My top two favorite games of this gen are The Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption, and both are easily up there with the greatest I have ever played. Giving a score a 10/10 doesn't mean it is perfect, but rather it is a complete, quality product that sets a standard for other games to come in that genre, and for me The Last of Us does that and more. I feel justified in spending 60 dollars on an extremely well made product that I will be playing through again and spending many hours I'm sure on the fantastic multiplayer. With a game that has so much hype and attention there will be much criticism by a lot of people that feel it doesn't deserve all of it, and The Last of Us is not without faults. The friendly A.I. at times was a bit clumsy and could be annoying, but for the most part helped out and was never really a problem. The human enemy A.I. were by no means strategic geniuses but kept me on my toes and moving around for cover. I noticed minor glitches here and there but nothing that ruined the game at all, like getting stuck by a tree and having a hard time moving. The story is fantastic and one of the most well done in any game I have played, and the music adds so much to the dramatic feel without ever being cheesy. The gameplay is tense and a good mix between shootouts and stealth, with the infected it's nice to just slip by them without having to fight. Speaking of the infected, I shouted about 3 or 4 times playing the game when being spotted, accidentally knocking over  something you didn't see and hearing them scream and run at you can be disturbing. The feeling you get as you move through the story and characters interact in different ways is strange for a game, it's almost like you're watching real people interact and it can affect you. Some people don't like or understand the ending, but I thought it was extremely human and the decisions Joel has to make would be very hard for anyone, you will see what I mean. The multiplayer is a bit more slow paced and extremely team oriented, you must stick together to succeed! I love it and am fully addicted to it, I like it more than uncharted 3 multiplayer, even though uncharted 3's was great too. I just feel they need more types of multiplayer modes and options, but so far so great. The Last of Us is a hard game at times, if you don't want a challenge you may want to play on easy.

I could only imagine if they would have waited and released the game on the PS4 and how it would have looked on that. There are a few technical glitches that I saw, but that will happen with almost every game.,,Gameplay,There are some comparisons to Uncharted, however in order to survive, especially on harder difficulties, stealth is key in getting through most of the game. When actually shooting it does feel a lot like Uncharted which is not necessarily a bad thing. One caveat, to this is the fact that Ellie and your other companions you travel with will sometimes walk right in front of enemies without them even noticing. While this breaks some of the immersion, I can see why they did it. They didn't want your success of stealth to be determined by your companions movements which would have made the stealth more frustrating  The puzzles in the game and the gathering of supplies to craft items are fairly generic except that when crafting, time continues on so you may have to be quick when crafting something of importance.,,Multiplayer,I have played a little mulitplayer and while it's interesting, it doesn't really appeal to me and it appears to be a fairly large learning curve for it. However, this is not why you buy this game.,,This game is on my list for top games of 2013.,If you own a PS3 and are on the fence about this game, I recommend renting it because the multiplayer is fairly average.

Possibly the best thing about The Last of Us is that you get emotionally attached to the characters.

I knew this game would be good. Let's be honest, you don't make Uncharted games and not give us a decent game but I wasn't prepared for this. The Last of Us is astonishingly amazing. It might turn out to be the game that defines the PS3. It's extraordinary!! Any PS3 owner who doesn't own this doesn't deserve to have the console. It's a masterpiece from start to finish. The game follows the journey of Joel and Ellie, who travel across a post-apocalyptic America in 2033 following the outbreak of a mutant cordyceps as they seek The Fireflies, a resistance group who believe Ellie has the cure to save the world. The story is captivating and an emotional tour-de-force throughout. Never has a game touched me so much as this. Its full of emotional highs and lows where every decision has a consequence as you battle zombie-like infected mutants, bandits and cannibals as you battle across a savaged USA. The setting is actually stunning. The post-apocalyptic America is mesmerising and so authentic. Naughty Dog really have raised the bar once again. The scenery is beautiful. And graphically, this is as good as it gets. It's frightening to think what Naughty Dog will have instore with next gen. The gameplay is near flawless. Much like Uncharted but more free flowing. The environments really play a vital part and the stealth aspect was a splendid inclusion. It really makes you as the gamer in charge of the method you wish to complete the game because enemies react differently depending on your approach. Your also able to craft weapons during the game which again is genius! The story is where The Last of Us is truly exceptional. It's such a rewarding and exhilarating experience. Right from the tragic beginning to the contentious ending. It's an unforgettable game The journey and the experience alone are awesome. You feel part of Joel and Ellie's story.

beheadedchicken,"Before the release of The Last of Us, Naughty Dog expressed their focus with the game: Narrative and emotion. These two things are arguably the weakest overall aspects of games on the market, and this issue has been addressed and the bar set. The characters are full of depth and realism, and you deeply care for them by the end. You are emotionally connected to these characters. When a person is emotionally invested in something, every aspect about it is highlighted or emphasized in some way. The gameplay is slow, but perfect. Combat is brutal and heavy. Every shot, punch, and swing of the bat feels satisfying. The stealth is largely basic, but any other editions would have felt contrived. The multiplayer is amazing as well. Similar in pace to the singleplayer, small teams allow for strategic play and refreshing competitive competition. You'll be hoping that the future DLC will add on to the somewhat slim experience. For some time now, many others have tried to do what Naughty Dog has done, but have failed. They've sacrificed interesting gameplay for a strong narrative. These games are not balanced, and split their audience. The Last of Us hits this balance perfectly. It's refreshing to see a game succeed in every objective it set out to do. You won't forget this classic game anytime soon. One of the generation's greats.",normal,ps3,2013-07-02,English,2,0,10,train

EVERYTHING IS AWESOME! except...,the combat! it's total BS! this game demands you to use stealth! dont try to shoot everyone in the face because you cant! you are extremely underpowered against the others, especially soldiers and clickers are the most annoying thing about the game! that's the only thing that i didnt like about the game, apart from that its amazing!",expanded,ps3,2013-07-02,English,1,0,9,train
Matiben,"The post-apocalyptic world of The Last of Us, where an infection caused by mutated mushroom turns people in raging beast with rabies, and later after years of infection, into joyfully clicking, blind clickers, who navigate with echo-sounding. After twenty years of infection, the protagonist Joel, your friendly neighborhood smuggler, gets an unusual task, which takes him through post-apocalyptic America, through areas, which are controlled by either the infected or the hostile gangs. This game is PS3 Exclusive and, my god, it is awesome. With up-to-date graphics and mechanics mixed with original story and the feeling of that survival instinct, this game really feels like a true story of survival and struggle. The game has also great upgrade system, crafting and journal using Joels backpack. The character development is also excellent, seeing Joel turn from a lowly smuggler into a tough guy and sadistic torturer. The games combat and exploration mechanics, as mentioned, are fantastic. From trying to reach a certain place to eliminating rooms full of enemies silently. The game also has a lot of different weapons from machetes and bows to sawed-off shotguns and flamethrowers. Weapons can be upgraded at a workbench with scrap metal that you can find by exploring. Even though the game has variety of weapons, the ammunition is limited, you must shoot with precision and make almost every shot count. You also can craft first-aid kits, nailbombs, molotov  sugar-explosives that work as smokescreen and of course: homemade prison shanks for opening treasure rooms and taking out enemies more quickly and silently than choking them to death.  The weaponry, sneaking, mechanics, story and realistic AI make this game a blockbuster.",normal,ps3,2013-07-02,English,1,0,9,train
Adudewhoreviews,"The Last Of Us is without a doubt in my mind a great game. Like Bioshock Infinite, you are really just escorting a girl from one place to another. However in Bioshock Infinte you end up caring a lot about Elizabeth (the girl you escort). However Bioshock's gameplay was just a bit above average in my opinion. The Last Of Us's gameplay is good. If you have played any of the Uncharted games then you should be a bit familiar with the gameplay here. The story here is great and you end up caring for the girl, Ellie. The voice acting here is great, Troy Baker kills it as Joel. The graphics are gorgeous for a ps3 game. Overall I think it's a great game and one that should definitely be considered for GOTY.",normal,ps3,2013-07-02,English,1,0,9,train
MetaKz,"First off, let me say that this game has one of the greatest moments in gaming: The intro. If you've played the game, you know exactly what I'm talking about.,,Secondly, I did give the game an 8, but I totally understand why everyone is giving the game a 10. It all depends on your expectations. Are your expectations weighted more towards the playing the game? Or weighted more towards going through an experience?,,For me, I was expecting a little bit of both, and I was very happy overall. The story, art, sound design and tension during gameplay is probably the best you'll ever experience. However, I don't believe the game is a perfect 10 for a few reasons:,,1. Immersion. Naughty Dog has built an AMAZING world that pulls us in right away. We get invested into it from the get-go. With an intro like that, EVERYONE gets completely glued to the game. I bet most critics went  10/10!"" as soon as they finished the intro. It's that good. However, the downside to this is that when the game contains actions that don't make sense, it breaks the immersion. Most examples of this appear in combat sequences:,,1a. Your companions are ignored by enemy AI. This is forgiveable, because in such a crazy messed up world, the game would be way to hard to manage everyone.,,1b. Joel does NOT pick up ammo in a world where ammo is ""scarce"". This is a big one. When you see every human enemy blasting bullets in every direction while you only have 10 bullets, it's as if Naughty Dog is holding up a giant sign saying ""HEY! We did this intentionally to artificially increase tension!"". It does raise tension quite a lot, but it also doesn't seem to fit the mindset of a survivor.,,1c. Shivs. Why does Joel craft shivs that break when being used to stab people? The guy should just own a knife! (or a machete that doesn't break in 3 hits). It makes no sense, and in the world of The Last of Us... it'd be smart to own a knife. Those of you who have played the game know Joel has no excuse.,,1d. Enemies are ridiculously evil. Every enemy in this game (aside from one), was a one-note badguy. They would shoot you on sight, try to kill you for ""survival"", but then they turn around and go ""You killed my friends!"" For some reason it felt like we were supposed to feel bad that we were killing them, but on the other hand... screw them. They shot at me first! The first demo Naughty Dog showed at E3 felt like they initially wanted players to feel the moral weight of what they did to players, but... It doesn't work at all with the regular enemy AI.,,2. Puzzles were repetitive and simple. Let's face it, there are only 2 types of puzzles in this game. Drag a dumpter/palette/shelf to act as a stepping stone... or drag a wooden plank/ladder over a gap. Uncharted had much more interesting puzzles. I understand Joel is in the modern world, but I still think a little more could have been put into the puzzles we saw in this game. However, you could also consider every combat encounter a puzzle, as strategy played a very important part.,,3. A lot of forced walking around and looking at things. After that amazing intro, I didn't even notice I was spending so much time in scripted walking sequences. However, upon my second playthrough, I saw that the first hour of the game is basically walking sequences with a bit of stealth thrown in. Try a second playthrough, see if you felt the same way or not.,,Now, with all that said... how about the positives? These are the AMAZING things done by The Last of Us:,,1. Story. You will love the story. Nearly everyone will love the story.,2. Graphics. Some of the best on the PS3. In the game you encounter some animals, and they look amazing.,3. Sound Design. Clickers are extra creepy because of the sound they make. And gunshots can scare the crap out of you if you get spotted while sneaking around. It's great!,4. Tension during gameplay. During sequences with the infected (especially clickers), tension may be through the roof. The sneaking elements mixed with the way clickers work makes for a good time. Throwing bottles and bricks to trick your enemies feels 10 times more satisfying than throwing rocks in FarCry 3.,5. Grenades and Molotovs! They're so satisfying to use.,6. Strategy during gameplay. In the game, Joel is able to use his ""hearing"" ability (see: wallhack), to gauge enemy positions. This makes every combat sequence feel like a puzzle ready to be cracked wide open. And once you complete it... it feels gooood.,,Overall, The Last of Us is a very good game. However, I have the feeling most critics wrote their reviews when they were still high off the thrill of the ending. After taking a second playthrough, it's much easier to see the game objectively, and to get a better picture of how The Last of Us is as a game. The thing I find the strongest is the tension during gameplay. It adds a lot to the atmosphere. However, the atmosphere can be broken by a few design choices.,,Thank you Naughty Dog for another amazing game!",normal,ps3,2013-07-02,English,62,45,8,train

I'm going to try and sum up this review really quickly, saying that this is an ABSOLUTE MUST BUY for any PS3 owner. Heck, even Xbox owners should spend the money and buy a PS3 (even just before the new generation comes out!) just to experience this game. And that's my main point about this game. It's an experience. You see the characters changing, the story is fantastic and the atmosphere unforgettable. After playing 'The Walking Dead' by Telltale, I was skeptical as to whether any other game can meet the character development and story levels that Telltale games had produced. Naughty Dog have met if not surpassed the levels set by The Walking Dead. Yes there are a few glitches and the AI for followers such as Ellie can be a little cumbersome but the positives outweigh the negatives by so much that the Last of Us is worthy of a 10/10.",normal,ps3,2013-07-01,English,1,1,10,train

An as the game progressed I got more attached to the characters.

KriticallyReal,"This game is is amazing.  I'd hate to sound like everyone else and say that it's a masterpiece, but it is.  It's seriously one of the best games I've ever played.  Let's get the bad out of the way first, the AI can be a little bit dumb at times but nothing game breaking.  Another thing is that the puzzles fail to challenge you very much, but these are very minor complaints.,This game really makes you feel for the characters you're playing as.  Whenever you see a clicker attacking Ellie, you really get mad and attack the clicker with everything you have.  You really feel like you're in a hopeless, desolate world (which you are), and it really makes the atmosphere memorable.  The stealth is nothing too innovative, but it works like it should.  The combat system is good and has some really gruesome moments, like when literally blow someone's head right off their neck with a shotgun.  The scavenging is a really cool system and it works real well.  I often find myself searching every little crack and crevasse for more materials and the collectables (such as Firefly Pendants, comic books, and artifacts) are really cool and really reinforce the atmosphere set by the scenery.  The ending is satisfying.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but the ending isn't cliche by any means.,The multiplayer is great.  But just because it's great, doesn't mean it's not tacked on.  IT IS TACKED ON, but I enjoy it.  There are very few guns in the multiplayer (I think there were only like 8 or 9.) and same goes for the maps.  There are also multiple glitches that really ruin it for me.  This is a kind of multiplayer that you HAVE to play with friends, but most of time my friends can't connect to me at all which is a severe problem.  The multiplayer isn't like every other multiplayer.  It adds a social aspect with your Facebook friends and it really makes for some funny moments.  It's clear they didn't have enough time to finish the multiplayer, and that's sad considering it really had the opportunity to be something really amazing.,As my review comes to an end, I just want to say that The Last Of Us is truly one of the best games of, not just this generation, but of gaming history.

The_Schnelks,"Purchased the game on the release date.,Played through the single player story on Hard difficulty.  It took me 21 hours to complete.,Played about 2 hours of multiplayer.,,My impressions:,Story is fantastic.  The character development is very good and I liked how the world was fleshed out via optional conversations, newspaper clippings, notes and other artifacts.,The graphics are incredible and probably the best I've seen on PS3.  (I saw one review compare this to the PC, which is a stupid and meaningless comparison since the hardware is not comparable).,The controls are tight, although it took me some time to get accustomed since I don't play many 3rd person games (only played Uncharted 1 for Naughty Dog games).,Sound is great, with well-suited music that sets the right tone and some scary effects from the infected.,The gameplay is somewhat limited to the stealth mechanic, although you do gunfight with bandits and use a cover system.  I like the stealth mechanic and the listen mode, which allows you to listen and then see enemies through walls.,,Multiplayer:,It's a pretty different experience.  Teamwork and stealth are important.  There is some decent depth in terms of perk upgrades and weapons.  It's 4 v 4 so it's pretty important to work together and it can be tough with strangers who don't mesh.  I liked it quite a bit but I am still learning to craft items (like in the single player) and move with strategy.,,I've read some other comments and some thing I do agree with:,Once you've completed the single player you may not want to play again since the story is known.  There is a Survivor difficulty which takes away the listen mode and a New Game  which still allows you to keep weapon and ability upgrades.  There are also collectibles to find, some of which enhance your abilities.  I looked as much as possible but missed quite a bit.  At the Hard difficulty I had to replay much but I think 15-20 hours is probably normal time.,,The mulitplayer is good, but I'm not sure I'm into it enough to play it for a very long time (i.e. 20+ hours).  Still a good amount of content though.There is also DLC coming (for both single and multiplayer) if you are into that.,,I guess this could be the only criticism  that there is somewhat limited replay value  but it is there and there are trophies for completionists.  I would consider reasonable scores to be 7 -10, anything lower I think is unreasonable but you can decide for yourself.,,One last point  this game does use an online pass so used sales will probably not have multiplayer access.",normal,ps3,2013-07-01,English,0,0,9,train

But after playing it for a number of hours, I still haven't figured out what it is about this game that makes people think it deserves the accolades it's being given.,,It's not a bad game, it's a good game. It's far from perfect, and it's FAR from the ""game of the year"" love fest that has been heaped upon it.,,It took several hours of playing before I even started to care what happened to any of the characters, and was even glad one of them died so early. The repetitiveness of the game play was enough to bore me so much that I actually had to make myself continue to play it, just so I could try and get my $60 worth.,,The AI is at times non existent. Many times my character would be hiding from an enemy, but the NPC character with me would be running around bumping into the enemies, but they wouldn't notice?!?,,This is what I like to call a ""rinse and repeat"" game. You enter a ""level"", look for ammo, nuts and bolts, maybe a new weapon or a health kit, fight off a swarm of the same enemies, and then move on to the next level and do it all over again. And in between you are subjected to the emotional issues of each character and how they are trying not to get too close to each other for fear of losing someone they care about again.  *Snore*,,Like I said, not a bad game, it's a ""good"" game, but not even close to a game of the year candidate.",normal,ps3,2013-07-01,English,51,6,4,train

USMC0331,"This game is truly a GREAT GAME!,,First let me tell you about the SINGLEPLAYER.,I did my first playthrough on the hard difficulty setting, it took me about 20 hours to complete my first playthrough.  On the hard difficulty setting the game gives you the perfect amount of tension, because it  makes the enemies tough and it limits the amount of resources that you will find throughout the environment.  Thus making you fully think about how to approach each situation, and every encounter is unique thanks to these gameplay mechanics.  I cant speak for the easier difficulty settings but on the hard setting it did not allow me to run and gun through the entire game.  You learn to think differently with this game, you approach combat strategically because of limited resources.  The game is forgiving though in the sense that it does frequent autosaves so if you die, you dont have to go back too far. In my playthrough the longest time that I saw between autosaves was 8 minutes.  Naughty Dog did a fantastic job of keeping the combat fresh you arent just fighting ""zombies"" this whole game and the different enemies require different tactics. The crafting in the game adds depth with a slight RPG elements, in the future I would love to see more crafting options.  I had a lot of fun with this game and had a hard time turning it off every time, the gameplay is fun and addicting and the story is very compelling.,,Now for the MULTIPLAYER.,The multiplayer has the same controls as the singleplayer and the mechanics are the same for the most part.  There are two different multiplayer modes both are basically death match modes and they both pit 4 players against another 4 players, however one gives each side 20 lives (tickets) and the last team standing wins.  The other mode gives the players only one life and last team standing wins that round and they do several rounds per match.  The multiplayer can be very frustrating at times especially if you have a bad team or no one has microphones, I havent cussed this much at a game in a LONG TIME.  IN ORDER TO DO WELL IN THIS GAME YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR TEAM. Sorry for all the caps but I cant emphasize this point enough.",normal,ps3,2013-06-30,English,1,1,10,train

Watching these characters transform and bonding when they meet each other for the first time. I loved how both of the main characters were what they were looking for. Both with survivor guilt. They both needed someone. Also very interesting how they took the virus from the real world and implanted it in the game, very creative.Game has my respects, comedy/action/thriller/Adventure/Horror/Mystery/Drama.,,[Gameplay]-,Gameplay wise, the game does have minor issues like when Ellie keeps bumping on you and moving around in front of enemies, keeps making the game feel unrealistic at times  Not all the time  But other then that, the gameplay is truly amazing, i like how they integrated the eye candy along with the gameplay. And i noticed that the developers put 100% effort Start to Finish really amazing. I would say the puzzles were not  so difficult but then again, who said this was a game about solving puzzles?

PS_Gamer93,"Before I wrote this review, I made sure to get my facts straight regarding the argument that somehow The Last of Us is a ripoff of Bioshock: Infinite. I have decided (from going over it for awhile) that even though they have similarities, The Last of Us is in no way a ripoff given the fact that many games have a female sidekick. Elizabeth does a lot less for the main character than Ellie. They both give you health packs and ammo, but Ellie also helps you fight. I digress; the game is amazing-no less than what I would expect from Naughty Dog. The scenery is perfect and really brings the post-apocalyptic world to life. After finishing the game for the first time I had to stop and think about all of the issues portrayed in this game. This is not some game that you can just run through and just go in with guns blazing. This is a game that really takes a lot of thinking. The story line just as much so.

Gopher93,"As the life of the PS3 is coming to an end, Developer ""Naughty Dog"" makes sure that the console goes out on a bang. And what a bang they created.,,The Last of Us is a unique take of the popular post-apocalyptic story telling, creating an experience that feels familiar yet very unique, and in the end is very satisfying. The story revolves around two characters, Joel, an older man who is extremely experienced in survival, and Ellie, a 14 year old girl who only knows life in quarantine and is curious about life outside and before the epidemic. A fungal outbreak has decimated the country and has turned people into cannibalistic monsters.,,Joel has been given the task to escort Ellie to a group known as The Fireflies, a rebel group fighting the government in control, and also looking for a cure to the outbreak. Throughout the story the player sees the relationship between change from Ellie being nothing more than goods being delivered, to someone whom he really cares about, and his protection of her becomes almost an obsession. This leads to an excellent, and unpredicted ending that will make the player think.,,The gameplay is extremely unique and has a bit of a learning curve. It is not a typical stealth game, although stealth is important in order to survive. You can use stealth take downs to kill opponents, or fight them straight forward, or use a combonation of both. Staying stealthy however is quite difficult and you will find yourself fighting often.,,To avoid repetition, there are different types of enemies to fight. There are normal human enemies, who are intelligent and react to what you are doing or how you're fighting. There are infected known as Runners, who, as their name implies run at you to attack you, forcing you to fight through them, but you can easily be overrun by them. There are Clickers, who cannot see due to overgrown fungi on their faces, and use a creepy clicking sound to see you using echo location. They are extremely difficult and if they grab you, you are dead. Then there are Belchers, who are massive infected with fungi that act as armour plating and are extremely difficult to take down. Each of these use different tactics to take down and make the gameplay extremely fun and satisfying.,,Overall this is a fantastic game that should not be missed by any PS3 owner. The story is excellently written. It grabs your attention and will not let go. The voice acting of Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker are absolutely amazing. The gameplay is fun and challenging. The online multiplayer is unique and fun. This truely was the first game in a while that i did not want to stop playing.

The loading time for every game is too much and you will stop playing, probably, and that's a pity.,It's a really good game, for sure, but the hype, in my opinion, it's too high in this case.",normal,ps3,2013-06-30,English,0,0,8,train
Crext,"I stopped playing this game about 1/3 in. 1 week later I watched the online play through just for story, so I know what the fuzz will be about when we will be talking about this game later, as I am sure many of my friends will do. As for me, I didn't like it. It felt like a really simple game with very easy puzzles, who required nothing from you but looking around for stuff like a scavenger fool. Don't get me wrong, the opening was great, but after playing Bioshock:Infinite, I guess I was spoiled as the companion in that game was much better than the ones in this one, in regards to mechanism. If you stealth, they run around like idiots. If you swim across a place, your companion would use powerpuff magic to get to you. It does not feel as real as in Bioshock, and it makes it feel like the companion are just put into the game to not get in your way and be a conversationalist.,,Further on everyone are irrational idiots in this world. The environment and atmosphere does not collude with how the world is presented. If you even payed the slightest attention in the nature science classes or even the social sciences, you'd know some of the approaches done in this game are beyond stupid. It's like they wiped the world of anyone with a brain and left the idiots in charge, just to give you an excuse for a game. You have thriving wildlife, nature working just fine and the only problem are a bunch of people who can bite you and some underground fungus. I mean after you are done you've pretty much cleared a whole area of infected people, and could alone be the guardian of humanity, as these people represent no bigger threat than a bad neighborhood. Hell a 14 year old girl are wiping the floor with them, and could easily be cleared by the local militia in a matter of weeks. The fungus are not more dangerous than you can walk through it with a gas mask, you even have a god damn smuggling route through it regularly, yet this is just too hard to eradicate? Like, Come on! Also wtf is the obsession for a cure, from the looks of things you don't need it as the local crime lord packs a bigger punch than the infected ever will. The main character I could not relate to, as he was murdering people left and right ""because he have to in order to survive"" which is a  reason judged from the circumstances, only true in words ""because we told you so"" and not from a real threat presented in the game. Also he never even considered handing over Ellie to the proper authorities and instead goes through hell for an untrusted weak terrorist organization. Again, the stupidity is beyond what I can fathom. And I get it, this is not the real world, you have to accept some thing in order to keep the story going. Mass Effect was not great because they gave you schematics for their relay stations, but when they try to emerge you as a person into a game, and they try to make that game a survival horror based on what could happen in reality, then I feel that you should require somewhat realistic behavior and not boil it down to ""I'm a tough guy who can take care of a 14 year old in a post zombified world"".,,Now maybe this game is just not for me, I'm not a big fan of zombie games in general, though I don't dislike them either. I guess there will be no one to read this in the end, as I am on the wrong side of the mainstream fence on this one, but I guess I'll just write this for myself to help me understand why I didn't like it. I expected greatness, I expected a really good story, I expected immersion with my companions and character on a level of the best RPGs, and all I got was this world full of irrational idiots, a story about getting from A to B and a main character with zero choice other than making a fool out of himself over and over and over again.",normal,ps3,2013-06-30,English,10,3,6,train
UHgods,"Best game of the year. Best graphics, best song, cinematics, storyline... Characters of Joel and Ellie are absolutely brilliant! I love all of Naughty Dog's games!",expanded,ps3,2013-06-29,English,1,1,10,train
devillightning1,"There are lots of games that features zombies/infected or post apocalyptic enviroments, yet Naughty Dog has managed to push what is possible with the theme to show that an excellent story and fantastic cast of characters is just as important as gameplay and graphics. With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog has managed to combine all the important aspect that makes a game great to become a masterpiece that not only is one of the best games of this year, it may be the best game from this generation, even surpassing Naughty Dog's own Uncharted 2. You play as Joel, a survivor of a fungus pandemic. One of the best parts of the game is the interaction between Joel and Ellie as they travel across the post apocalyptic US. Joel is a harden survivor, who have already been through both before and after the pandemic, while Ellie was born into this harsh enviroment. This creates some great interactions between the character and Ellie, pushing the story forward. In this brutal enviroment, there is no right or wrong. Everything the survivors do are just trying to survive. The graphics in the game are amazing, with enviroments filled with details everywhere. Its amazing how Naughty Dog is able to improve the graphics from the Uncharted series and push it even further, squeezing every drop of power available from the PS3, making it one of the best looking game in this console generation. From the brutal winter to the overgrown buildings, the attention to detail really makes you feel immersed into the world of the game. The gameplay is also great, making you feel as if you are really fighting for survival. Ammo isnt found very often, making you feel that every shots is important. Melee is almost the same as the Uncharted series, only harder. Enemies do fight back when you engage in melee combat with them, unlike Uncharted 3 where the enemies only sometimes do a reversal and all you have to do is press another button. The sound is also excellent, with Gustavo Santaolalla's amazing soundtrack really puts you into the mood of the game. Still, Naughty Dog knows when to let nature take over the music, creating a perfect mix of musics and sound. Gunshots are loud and powerful, making even a simple pistol round feels powerful. Punches make you feel as if you are really punching and using melee weapons make the hits feel even more powerful and devastating.,,If you are still thinking about buying this game, just buy it and enjoy this masterpiece.",normal,ps3,2013-06-29,English,1,1,10,train

With that being said the Last of Us is currently one of the best story driven games I've played in awhile. First of all the worlds look amazing and taking the time to properly encode the sound just made the world that much more immerse on my surround sound system. The combat is very slow and based heavily on sneaking due to the lack of ammo and supplies laying around. However the final end of game combat mission knocked this game down a point for me as it tries to either force you to spend a ton of time sneaking be a 3rd person shooter all of a sudden which just doesn't work.,,The story is well done, the world is beautiful and I would put this on my list of 2013 must plays.",normal,ps3,2013-06-29,English,1,0,8,test
unsiin,"Really surprised by the good reception that this game has. It's barely a game, boring repetitive TPS gunplay with familiar enemy design. Those so called survival elements could easily be done in all games by simply limiting recourses in all other games. While they achieve this, they sacrifice all features that make a game fun, side missions, complex and varied levels, dynamic stories choices,  Also, the story is solid but there is no resolution at all in the last 30 mins, it's so predictable and badly done, Clearly preparing for more cash grab story dlcs. The atmosphere is great at times but jaggies and poor texture resolution prevent it to be perfect. However, the game has great animation details in combat, crafting, looting, walking, running etc. Detailed facial animation also helped characters to shine in cutscenes. It also has a functional MP that adds on replayability but I'm not an MP guy so it does little for me.

Randomman93,"This must be one of the best games i have ever played. I bought this game, as i wanted a great story game, and the reviews looked great- so i bought it. I was expecting a great game, and what i got was not a great game, it was perfect.,,The game has an amazing story, with very deep characters, and intresting athmosfere. I don't think this game was designed to be a horror game, but it still is pretty creepy at times. Nor was the game designed on the infected, but more on the story, and around the main characters. Thats a good thing, as you will be pulled into the story right after the beginning. Thats not to say the infected are not intresting, not at all. The infected in the game have diffrent abilities, making it extreamly fun encountering many infected at one time.,For example the normal walkers, will hear and see you (better eyesight than hearing), and the clickers will hear almost anything you do, but they can't see you. Not to mention they will kill you very fast. I have not seen more than these types yet, but i am certain there is bloaters and more infected later on.,,Then theres the multiplayer. The multiplayer is awesome. It is not only focused at teamwork, but also very focused at scavenging items around the maps, to create bombs, smoke bombs, and lots of other stuff. Also what is very intresting is how you have to be careful with your shots, as you have a very limited amount of bullets. The only ways to get more shots is to scavenge dead bodies, find toolboxes with ammo, or purchase ammo ingame with money you have from killed enemies, revives etc. You may also purchase some special weapons ingame, or better armor, or upgrade your main weapons ingame. Its all up to you how you spend that money, which makes the online so intresting. Want a better revolver? Go for it, wanna upgrade you hunting rifle? Go ahead. The game's multiplayer also features character customization, and a great class system, where you can equip diffrent abilities, like faster reviving, faster crafting, and more zoom on your handguns.,,Well that was my review, i hope you enjoyed it- and that you will enjoy the last of us.

DeckardPain,"UNBIASED REVIEW HERE --,(unlike the other rare hateful posts here),,This game was spectacular. I have not play The Walking Dead, but from what I've heard the two are very similar in the ways they present their story. After saying that, play this game on hard if you want the true survival feel which I believe this game needs to truly make an impact on the player. I normally don't get immersed in too many games' stories, but by playing this game on hard I found it really threw me into the game's atmosphere.,,Story: 10,Yes the story progresses slowly at first, it doesn't throw you into the action like a Call of Duty or Resident Evil game and that is a very good thing. This does not mean that the game's story is slow throughout, because it is not. The games story progresses at the perfect pace for a game such as this. The attachment you feel to the characters is perfect, and that is all I can say without dropping spoilers, but there are numerous times where you really feel for the characters.,,Environment: 10,The world of The Last of Us is almost a character of itself. The city sort of reclaiming itself after humanity has been removed is beautifully done. The game does not throw you into endless dark rooms with scary lighting just to impose forced horror elements, it actually presents a beautiful city that has its dark moments  areas. When you talk through parts of the city and you see hints of civilization that used to be there, it really hits home that this is a post apocalyptic type environment. The city is beautiful amid all of the chaos and destruction.,,Combat: 9,The only reason I'm giving the combat a 9 and not a 10, is because at some points you feel as though you are going through the motions of eliminating the infected as you would normally eliminate them. I can't even provide a way for them to improve upon it, it just felt like it was missing something and I can't put my finger on what that would be.,,Soundtrack: 10,The minimalistic soundtrack to this game with the subtle guitar riffs was absolutely perfect. There isn't really much else I can say about it, because its just perfect.,,Graphics: 9,Yes, this game's graphics are good for PS3 standards. However while playing the game it becomes relatively evident that the PS3 is coming up on being six and a half years old. That is not saying the engine is bad, the lighting is phenomenal, the game engine is great, but there are times where the graphics have some odd noticeable outdated issues. Maybe its because this game came out after E3 and all the new flashy graphics games coming out.,,In conclusion, I was honestly not a huge fan of the Uncharted series because it really just felt like Tomb Raider with more combat so I'm not jumping on the Naughty Dog bandwagon here. Capcom went on record saying the survival horror franchise was a dying game concept. Coming from an avid player of the survival horror franchise games, this game redefined the survival horror experience in an entirely new light for me and sort of says ""your move capcom"".",normal,ps3,2013-06-28,English,6,5,9,train
InspectorJ,"Zombie apocalypse games are a very common theme as of late, and The Last of Us is no exception. It twisted and turned the expected game-play for a zombie game into its own unique play-styles, and it is hard not to admit that the graphics are purely beautiful and atmospheric, and combined with the excellent voice acting it is easy to become immersed into the game.,However, there are few games that come without flaws: the AI of the game could have received some more work, making the combat quite easy and far from challenging resulting in no feeling of achievement or tension. Also, the only other issue I will personally put forth is a slight overuse of cliché  with exception to the ending   which made some aspects of the story predictable and thus losing its emotional connection to the player.,,But to conclude, The Last of Us, holds strong in a genre that is becoming common, and adds more spice to a meal that is starting to be eaten.",normal,ps3,2013-06-28,English,5,2,8,train

You have a choice, either go in guns blazing( only if you have enough ammo, trust me) Or you can go in stealth.

Mad-review,"The Last of us, argubably the greatest gaming experience one can and will have on a now soon to be defunct ps3 system. I for one believe that this game 'does' have features that don't amaze me and one maybe the lack of choice or decision making, because i believe that a game based so much on survival should give options and now you could say you are nearly always given the option of sneaking around a group of bandits or infected, but i mean more than that, i mean you always seemed to be climbing over a truck and jumping down the other side revolver in hand awaiting your next possible foe,in my opinion, you should be made to take risks outside the norm of being insta-killed by the same clicker for 10 minutes straight, after an hour into the game. i think you should in a survival game that you should be rewarded and punished bearing on the things you do,i believe there could have mixed it up a tiny bit more, maybe had two paths and you had to choose one or you could split up, which could then mean that either Joel or Ellie are put in a dire position and that you would need to rescue them(maybe not my greatest idea).And at the end,(i know on thin ice for spoilers) i think that ND could have let you decide the fate of our loved protagonists, (MEGA SPOILERS)--> Also at the very death of the game when Ellie questions Joel on the whole cured humanity lies, and Joel swears by his lies, this to me described how attitude and human nature change in a time of crisis and in this post-apocalyptic world is built on deceit and there is little or no form of an 'honest living' earned by anyone, even the main characters constantly screw people over(and get screwed). But this game is superb and with out a doubt is one of the best that the ps3 has seen, the story is phenomenal, the voice acting makes every other game look brutal, the visuals are truly astounding and to create a kind of awe, and the game will give you plenty of comics, alcohol, rags and ammo if you explore the world. The trophies are intelligent, they are long term and difficult and can only be obtained by a very shrewd and hardworking person, they take effort and thats something i think is great because it reflects on the whole game, basically life isn't easy. Games such as COD award you too easily, you shot a plane out of the air heres a bronze trophy(not great example) and other menial and trivial tasks are performed just for trophies sake. But not in The last of us, this is a thriller an emotional journey with gore and gruesomeness, that aides the stealthy and gives the Rambo types a chance. The only easy trophy this game has other than completing the game(which isn't easy) is the bronze for crafting every item.,The characters of Joel and Ellie are personified in a way that no other game can live up to, the characters are very relatable to the 14 year old girls and 50+ year old men that played this game(of which there is few). They help the emotional journey, they make it feel worthwhile and on completing this game you feel quite relieved and maybe a bit emotional(ya big girls). It pulls and our heart strings it makes us want to shout at the TV, it makes us want to burn the crap out of some crazy zombie-like people, with a ridiculous flamethrower that you just pick up at a college dorm(sum crazy parties they must have). The workbench is gaming genius, it helps us feel like we are doing something useful that will eventually help us blast runners to bits. I think a lot of people have said its just perfect but I don't think that, it is definitely fantastic but nothing is perfect, everything has flaws but the last of us has quite few and i only believe it can be equaled by others as it has set the bar very high. People say that they actual gameplay, shooting parts aren't great and the running around of your allies at all kinds of times can make it a small bit confusing to whether your actually still in some sort of incognito or if you should start running or firing.,Another thing this game shows as it develops how humans push themselves to the limits if they believe the cause is just and the game portrays the characters hardships,emotional devastation and losses in a very real and smart way. A game which i wish this could have been slightly more like would be Spec Ops: the line, with its insanity which is already quite similar but spec ops' alternate endings and much decision making really gives the gamer a sense that they are unique and actually trawling through Dubai's sands. That is the only thing this game is missing a tiny extra little bit of individuality to make you feel like you really just stood on that guys face. If your still reading this I'm impressed, 4700 characters ago i didn't think id be writing 500 characters but here i am, the greatest game ever made maybe, some of the most fun I've ever had, definitely.,I hope you like this, and agree with some of my points, this is my first review and I did it cause the last of us gave me such pleasure.",normal,ps3,2013-06-27,English,2,1,10,test

The 'backpack' mechanic as I like to call it is pretty well thought out, and you will be spending some time there, crafting medical kits, molotovs, and checking your collectibles. Joel & Ellie goes far beyond what my expectations were before I played the game for myself. The interaction between the two is awesome, the idle talk they have about the surroundings they're in. Ellie will also find some ammo/supplies for you to use from time to time, kinda like Elizabeth in the amazing BioShock Infinite. The emotion you will have throughout the game with these characters is strong, you will feel a bond and care about the characters.,,I also have to mention the soundtrack in this game, composed by Gustavo Santaolalla, really makes you feel like you are in a Post-Apocalyptic scenario,,The graphics are stunning with skyscrapers that are destroyed in the background, the dark skies, and the gritty environment that Joel and Ellie is in. I also got to mention that the ambiance is spot on.,,Multiplayer is a very nice addition and kept me going after the storyline was over. The multiplayer is called 'Factions' and have you in charge of your own 'clan' that you need to feed. To gather food and supplies you need to go into online matches and pick up supplies off dead bodies or boxes scattered over the map, which i really like. You'll also be spending time in stealth mode while in a match, which I haven't really used in a game with PvP matches.,,The Last of Us is a must buy. Naughty Dog nailed this game, and I did not find anything wrong with it at all.,It is definitely a Game of the Year contender, and I can't wait for what Naughty Dog will bring us next.,I am looking forward to this year, when the Playstation 4 is coming out and all the awesome looking new games.,,This game deserves my full 10 out of 10.,,- Custer",normal,ps3,2013-06-27,English,2,1,10,test

RaidenDP,"This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever made. Almost flawless design, excellent execution and an emotionally investing story that can safely be placed among gaming's finest. ""The Last of Us"" is what many games try to be, yet few succeed  an experience. It takes you on a ride through the zombie-infested continent and never allows you to let go. Many are calling it the best PS3 exclusive of all time, and I can certainly see why. ""The Last of Us"" is a masterpiece!",normal,ps3,2013-06-27,English,2,1,10,test
Falcon_D_Storms,"This game is almost immediately evocative of works such as The Road, and the lesser-known Earth Abides, with strong hints of ""I Am Legend"". It plays like Uncharted, meets Fallout, meets the original Resident Evil.,,What I'm going to cover first is the centerpiece of the game, the characters. The highly detailed character graphics, intricate facial animations, and sincere voice acting set a new high standard for the video game medium all by themselves. These technical aspects, combined with excellent characters that simply ooze verisimilitude, form something truly special. The end of the game in particular made me think that the voice actors must have done a minimum of 1,000 takes to achieve the perfect subtlety they deliver their lines with.,,The controls and gunplay are realistic, but not as realistic as the brutal depiction of violence  which is so realistic that it's not even fun in the ""wee!"" sense. This seems to be the entire theme of the game. It is the opposite of a bullet hell shooter but even more frantic. It is, in turns, nerve-wracking and heart-wrenching (if you have any semblance of a soul residing in the dying coals of your heart)  the fresh take on ""zombies"" as presented by the Fungus-controlled Infected such as Clickers, delivers an apt sense of dread and tension. If you think that's a negative, you might want to stick to Zen Pinball 3D. In giving you pleasure while not being pleasant, The Last of Us elevates the medium to new heights; even making me pause and wonder if ""game"" is the correct word for it, despite the fact that you are given full control and are able to tackle any given situation with great freedom.,,From a design perspective, The Last of Us is a well-oiled machine. It makes great strides in eliminating the disconnect between gameplay and story, known as ludonarrative dissonance, almost universally present in any action game that tries to present an unique story. The rules work almost the same in a cutscene as they do when you have control of the characters. Joel cannot be shot in the eye 20 times during the course of playing and be totally fine, and then need a trip to the E.R. when he stubs his toe in a cutscene.,,Both my wife and I completed the story in about 18 hours. To give perspective, we don't rush through things, we explore and experiment quite a bit. I was obsessed with what the length of the game would be before I played it, and I now see that this was folly. I like to get a lot of playtime for my 60 dollars, but it would have been a huge disservice to us for Naughty Dog to artificially extend the playtime just for that reason (although you can argue that's what multiplayer is). The game is as long as the story, and any significant changes to what we ended up with would have ruined it. Do not wish for this to be a longer or shorter game. What value The Last of Us does not deliver in Skyrim-esque length, it delivers in sheer quality.,,Speaking of multiplayer, I haven't even redeemed my online code yet and there's a chance that I may never (honestly, the story isn't ""Campaign Mode"", ""Story Mode"", or ""Singleplayer Mode, it's just the game), so all I can say is that I'm intrigued by the playmode where there are no respawns; as it has the potential to alter the ubiquitous ""LEEEROOY JENKINS"" enthusiasm plaguing most online multiplayer games. Nobody's going to want to do that if it means they have to wait until the next match. The multiplayer mode also includes elements from the actual game, such as crafting, and the current modes center around the concept of survival but do not feature non-human enemies from the game, such as Clickers, or those things that are more deadly than Clickers.,,And that, Dear Reader, is the best and most accurate spoiler-free review that you will read for The Last of Us. You need not read any other, especially not those that risibly pan the game just for attention. In fact, you shouldn't even be reading what I'm typing right now, because you should be buying or playing the game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-27,English,3,1,10,train

stewmo,"I have decided to wait a little bit before reviewing this game, so that I can let the hype and expectations settle before they cloud my judgement in an early review. However, my opinions of this game have not changed since the first second I played it, and that is that this game is a masterpiece. This game comes as something of a swam song from Naughty Dog on the PS3, a special game to kick off the PS4 and begin to close out the PS3 era, much akin to Sony Santa Monica's God of War 2.,,For the record, I am not going to talk about the multiplayer, which I've heard is fantastic, but never played and I don't really think that is what the game is about.,,Something you will notice off the bat are the very high production values. There is a great original score, talented voice acting, and top notch graphics and animations in this game. However, all of that would not begin to matter if the game did not come through in the gameplay and story department. Lucky for us, it does.,,You play as Joel, a hardened man riddled with grief from a tragic event 20 years before the story occurs. Through some *spoiler-free* circumstances, he is charged with transporting a young girl, Ellie, across a fungus-ravaged United States. The story is really what drives this game home, and is what you will remember it for. There is a range of feelings that you will get from this game, from sadness and happiness to even anger. This is the game that people will be talking about for years to come, and most of that is due to it's awesome story.,,Now, this would all be for nothing if it didn't have enjoyable gameplay, something The Last of Us also delivers on. You control Joel for most of the game. Stealth plays a major role and while it isn't technically a necessity, if you want some ammo saved for the more difficult encounters, you will need to keep the noise down. Having such sheer numbers of enemies to face means that the tension really builds, especially with Clicker and Bloater Infected enemies, there is an undeniable tension that you will feel, because one wrong step can mean brutal death at the hands of these beasts. You can turn the tables back in your favour with an awesome crafting system, which lets you create tools of both stealth and war. Create a smoke bomb to stun human enemies while you go in for the takedown, create a health kit to heal yourself, or upgrade your weapon to one-hit kill.,,All of this comes together in an excellent package, which not only happens to be the best Playstation 3 exclusive, but joins the conversation for best of the generation.",normal,ps3,2013-06-27,English,3,1,10,train

PublicStatement,"Okay, so here is my honest, fair review of The Last Of Us, no biased opinion.,When I first started to hear the hype about this game, it excited me, I was eager to embark on this survival/horror genre, as a change from the games I would usually review.,When I finally set up the game, and experienced the first mission, that first mission stunned me. Considering the PS3's now out of date hardware, the visuals were impecible, truly a piece of art from naughty dog from many of the console games I have experienced.,The physics of 'Sarah' (Joel's daughter) albeit fairly clumsy at times, werevery realistic, the sway and the way she would react to certain actions I found quite astonishing. Playing further across the game, I did start to notice a few hiccups here and there. For one, the strangling animation from Joel, there is only one of these animations, you will pick up on it, and it does become old fairly quick. Not to say the combat is repetitive, I actually find the bloodthirst and the interactive environments quite amusing, but it's just the little things like a mix up of animations I would like to see more of. Getting into the enemies of this game, they can also be very annoying, for the simple fact that this game makes you want to use bullets as it shows off the game to be another shoot' em up, but you are actually very lacking in bullets and equipment which you must find.,Aside from these few annoyances, I must say that this is still a very spectacular experience, and the story alone is the thing that will make you want to play to the end, it will leave you speechless, with some satisfying multiplayer for replayability.,I give this game 9/10, for the fact that its nearly perfect, but not quite a 10 yet.,,- PublicStatement.",normal,ps3,2013-06-27,English,1,0,9,train
mc_samm3r,"I went into this this game thinking it was kind of overhyped and overrated, however when I started playing I was almost immediately hooked. This title offers one of the greatest stories told in gaming, a cast of very well developed characters, and amazing graphics. Gameplay is pretty good too, although there have been a lot of complaints about the ""clunky"" shooting/ fighting mechanics, i personally think that it makes the game more realistic. I was completely interested from start to finish as the suspense in this game is constant. At some points in the game, you will die many times and it is frustrating, but it never feels unfair as it makes you think of new ways to approach the situation at hand. The only negative thing I have to say is very minor and that is that  the AI can't detect Ellie during stealth moments so she'll be doing something stupid like whistling, telling jokes, or sometimes even walking into enemy while you're trying to quietly sneak by.

Metagap,"Very rarely do books, movies or video games alike leave you feeling empty, tense and heartfelt all at the same time; the Last of Us did just that.,,The Last of Us is set in a typical post-apocalyptic world which makes players vulnerable to subjecting the game to the clichés and the tropes it is founded on. As a result, Naughty Dog actively plays with these clichés to create a fresh and innovative world. Where the standard dark shades of brown in typical zombie environments usually dominate, the Last of Us opts for a rich, green environment which poetically demonstrates nature reclaiming the urban environment. Furthermore, we have the artefacts not only give pockets of information about the lost world but also document the lives of off-screen characters and how they coped with society’s decay. It is these small details that give the Last of Us a believable and enjoyable setting, whilst keeping with the overall sombre and broken tone.,,Beyond the collectables and the environment, the storytelling in the Last of Us is where the game truly shines. In opting for a linear narrative, the game gets likened to that of a novel which allows it to effectively tell a story. Throughout the game, players are never actually given choice as to how the storyline proceeds which sets it apart from other apocalyptic games. Right from the prologue, we get the sombre and hopeless world, whilst caring and rooting for the characters, often to no avail.,,That is where the focus of the game lies character interaction. Throughout the game you play as Joel, a middle-aged man hardened by the events of the outbreak who is accompanied by Ellie, a highly convincing, snark 14-year old girl. Their interactions serve to be one of the most endearing and realistic conversations in this generation’s games. Even secondary characters are given great depth which is very refreshing, with amazing voice acting complementing this remarkable cast of characters.,,Where the Last of Us differs from its conventional gaming counterparts is its realism. The violence never feels gratuitous; rather it feels necessary in order to survive. Instead of opting for psychedelic drugs a la Far Cry, the game sticks to traditional human tactics such as stealth, crafting, and conventional weaponry.,,As a result, the gameplay may feel lacklustre compared to those used to games such as Uncharted or Red Dead Redemption however that calculating gameplay only serves to add to that tense atmosphere. Everything from crafting and interacting are all done in real time which makes every action deliberate and urgent. Scavenging can be time consuming but is quite necessary to survive in this harsh world. This is especially true for harder game modes such as “Hard” and “Survivor” modes where supplies are scarce. From bullets, to alcohol, to rags and tape, everything you collect has purpose and how you use these tools is how Naughty Dog gives its players freedom. What was slightly disappointing was the lack of variety the crafting can be used for late game but that is a small complaint compared to the realistic gameplay the Last of Us offers.,,Overall the game seems designed for older players, but as a teenager myself, I can recommend The Last of Us to any players looking for a good narrative, so long as they are mature enough to handle the dark themes the Last of Us deals with. Don’t go in a slave to expectations and I can guarantee you will go out with your emotional strings tugged, and a gaming experience unforgettable.,,And the game ended perfectly.",normal,ps3,2013-06-26,English,4,1,10,train

I get the whole emotional angle Naughty Dog is trying to sell. But my experience although good taken as a whole was at times so bad I almost didn't finish the game.,,Number 1: The combat sucks. It is just a stupid 3rd person shooter with crafting and RPG elements. Occasionally stealth  is involved. There are moments perfectly crafted with great pacing and great balance of gameplay and set pieces. Than there are stupid moments. Teleporting zombies, human enemies that flank you no matter where you are(they go through walls apparently). Sadly these moments are not rare and for every good combat gameplay piece there is a stupidly broken one. Maybe it's just the way I played. I don't know, if you enjoy this type of BS or don't really care you will have a better experience. To me the gameplay feels like a filler between emotional cut scenes and set pieces. And that's bad. Also BOSS FIGTS. For the love of God. BOSS FIGHTS.,,Number 2: The story is at best OK. They chose a fungus as the reason for the zombie apocalypse and than they go nowhere with it. Every single character that dies, dies because of zombie bites. You know, that cliché. Where they get bit and they hide it. It happens twice because once was not enough. Also the writing is mind blowing bad. ""We've got to get out of here"" and it's many variants are used constantly along with all the other cliché lines Hollywood has been using for years. The ending is stupid also but I will not spoil it for you(there really is nothing to spoil).,,Number 3: Even with all these game breaking flaws I enjoyed the game enough to finish it. So I gave it a 7/10 because emotional cut scenes aside there's just nothing here.

It looks good but underneath the fancy graphics its pretty basic. Games seem to be becoming more and more easy and this is too easy. Survivor mode is disabled until you beat the game. The enemy AI is so forgiving and you might find your given health out of nowhere just because they don't want you to get frustrated. I should say the voice acting is brilliant, though the supporting characters you meet along the way are dull and boring.

ProdigyGamer21,"Meta scores for critic reviews doesn't mean anything, but when 90% of the people here are saying o its great its the best game ever, its revolutionary. I have a few words for you, its none of the above. I have been playing games since i was 4(NES days) and I have played a lot of games, this is not one of the best its un original, and gets monotonous fast.,,Let's go over the negatives since there are clearly more negatives:(positives mixed in since there aren't a lot of them),1) this game took bits and pieces of many games, including tomb raider, of course uncharted, zelda, and mainly survival horror, and mainly RE(resident evil). So how do you take a mesh of those games and make something terrible out of it.,,1) gameplay  the gameplay feels very stiff, and unorganized, why should i have to hit 3 different buttons just to heal and switch weapons. On top of that if you dont upgrade your holster it virutally makes it impossible toward the end to be a good shot, not like you shoot much anyways because you'll die.,Which brings me to the next point why do you even have a gun system if the rules of the game penalize you for it unless you're playing on easy. As being a developer myself this completely boggled my mind, why is it on normal you really don't take that much more damage from enemies, than playing on hard especially snipers and clickers. I think the sense system is weak, especially towards the end of the game where theres enemies everywhere and then you run into them because you can't see them even at level 3 maxed out.,The worst part about the gameplay altogether has no replay value unlike crash bandicoot and uncharted series, just a complete let down gameplay wise. The final note here would be theres absolutely no character development until about halfway through the game, and even still the characters have no personality, there just swearing the whole time,,2) Sound  there nothing i can say except it had the most unbalanced sfx ever. You shoot your gun or throw a nail grenade, or molotov  the sounds is sooooo loud, yet you can't hear the characters talking, thats flat out obnoxious and annoying. my biggest crack down on the sound is if you're not near a conversation and hunting down parts to upgrade Joel never responds to the questions askled by the other cast of characters, which helps develop character.,,3) Final results: this game failed to incorporate the other ideas it took from other games to make it there own, you can't live vicariously through any of the characters. The sound efffects are just flat out annoying, they didnt develop a new shooting system even though they call it original and amazing. I t was good for uncharted but not for this game. The idea of the game is good, the world is decaying and there might be hope left(thumbs up there),,for these reasons, i cant comprehend why people love this game,, especially since a lot of the perfect 10 scores basically all same the thing as the critics do, who don't criticize games the way they use to. Because we live in a society where we don't want confrontation anymore because we are afraid to get burned. This is a perfect example, the most overhyped terrible game I have ever played in the last 13 years,Also everyone is like its a perfect game, if you think there is such thing is a perfect game/application you're sorely mistaken. I personally disliked this game so much that i hope Gta V wins Goty, thats how bad i think this game was. I t had an original idea they just weren't implemented correctly, like most modern games.

The story was overall emotionally heartbreaking, and when I mean emotionally heartbreaking, I mean that I had such a connection with the characters, that at the end of it, I felt like I needed more of the game, not only that, but after beating the game, I went in my brothers room, watching him play Skyrim for at least 3 hours because I was extremely upset, thinking about the last hour of the game. It's also really long, and it has ton of replay value, more or less, this game is a masterpiece, theres is usually only 1 or maybe 2 game every year that I love this much, and I am happy that The Last of Us is the one I have committed to and complete, and I have never made a review this long, because there weren't many other games that I could write a review this long for.

Gorgeous graphics, amazing voice acting, and the fact that they used real actors and motion captured  them makes the characters so much more real than then already are. The storyline is phenomenal, truly Hollywood worthy, it really is a one in all package. 15 minutes into the game people are fighting off tears (including myself). The relationship between Joel and Ellie really strengthens once advancing into the game. The way that Naughty Dog wrote the story line really makes you care about the characters, and you are always wondering what will happen to them next. Once playing, I'd doubt you'd be able to put the Dualshock down, it keeps you on the edge of your seat as it has a very gripping and compelling storyline that really, really affects you emotionally. Naughty Dog really pushed the PS3 to it's very limits. Very impressed how well the developers created this astonishing looking game will a very limited 256mbs of RAM. I've never been so affected by a video game, but The Last of Us sure changed that. If you have a PS3 then this is a MUST have. If you're considering buying this, then buy it.

phdr_vrba,"Okay, this is the final review update. There is stuff mentoned some pricks may consider a minor spoilers.,,After the prologue, where you can already drool over borderline next-gen graphics, game slows to a crawl and stays there for some 4-5 hours  about 1/4 of the whole game. During that time, not much interesting happens, you'll just learn about the game mechanics and weird and somewhat clunky control scheme.,,You may also notice a bunch of bugs and graphical glitches the game has quite a lot of those, especially when compared to Uncharted games.,,Eventually you'll meet the guy named Bill and things will slowly get better. You'll start to get the hang of stealth and combat and, more importantly, the story of Joel and Ellie will start grow on you. To be honest, caring about the main characters is the main drive of the whole game, because while stealth will get good, it never quite gets great and shooting on its own felt kinda crappy all the way till the end.,,The resulting mix of stealth and action does however feel very natural and not being for various AI cheats, The Last of Us would have passed for a great stealth game. But the AI cheats and that kinda undermines your efforts to stay hidden. Enemies sometims just start walking towards you for no reason, or some script will send them your way, or reinforcements will come from who knows where, already aware of your position, etc. The hearing mechanics that allows you to detect enemies behind obstacles if they are making noise does not work on those in ""other areas"" and it is not good when ""nobody around"" turns into ""four guys right in front of you"" just because you walked through some door or went up the stairs.,,AI cheating is probably the problem #1 I have with this game. There are various less important things there, actualy there is quite a lot of them TLoU certainly could use more polish on many fronts but I'd say that only the AI related stuff has serious impact on gamplay. (Ok, maybe some ""levels"" like hotel or campus could be shorter and the part in the snowstorm was boring pain in the ass.),,Relationship between Joel and Elie is the meat of the story the events through the game are but a way to shape that relationship and the ending, while emotionaly strong, was quite predictable in its conclusion.,,At first I thought TLoU is a failed game that I Am Alive is a better choice with similiar atmosphere. But nah, the strengths of The Last of Us lie elsewhere. You have to endure some mediocore gameplay to get to the good stuff, but in the end it was worth it.

endallchaos,"I wouldn't say this game is perfect, but it certainly is a Masterpiece. I've been waiting for this game since it was announced back in 2011, I pre ordered it in 2012, the wait was long, but it's finally here. (prologue/intro), The game starts with Joel's daughter waking up to uncle tommy's phone call, you walk down the hall to Joel's room to find out what is happening, you see on the TV that something bad is happening when explosion happens and then you turn to the window and realize that it was really close to the house, you walk down stairs to find your dad, you find him and he tells you that something is very wrong, a neighbor gets in the house, Joel Shots him and he walks with his daughter and tells her that something is not right, soon later, you get in the truck of Uncle Tommy and drive off, as you sit in the back you see that everything is starting to go to hell, people houses are burning, police cars everywhere, people running left to right. The 3 characters  (Joel, daughter, and tommy) had to leave the car after it was crashed, they go down a hall to find out there we're more infected there, they run into a bar and tommy tells joel and his daughter to run and he will catch up, you run down a hill and then up to meet up with a military personal. he tells them to stop and then shoots them, they both roll down the hill and Joel stands up to find out that his daughter was shot, shortly after she was dead. This seen was the most emotional/heart breaking part of the game, for me,  even though I didn't know the character very well, I felt very sad to see the little girl die in Joel's arms. The game is very emotional and compelling, it's no Uncharted, this game is a lot more darker than the previous work of Naughty Dog. It's a much slower pace compared to Uncharted and the characters seem to be more alive, you could feel their emotions a lot more. The voice acting was amazing, the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard in a Video Game, the graphics  had it's ups and downs, sometimes it looked better than Uncharted 3 and sometimes is looks a tiny bit worse, but lets not forget that this game is a lot bigger than the previous franchises and has a lot more stuff going on, it's also running on the PS3, which is an old piece of hardware. There is some texture pop ins and their was some glitches, but nothing that would ruin the experience. The AI is very smart, you can not run and gun in this game, if you do, you will find yourself very frustrated, because this is more of a stealth kind of game, the bullets and items you find (to craft stuff) are limited, sometimes you will think; 'hey, I have plenty of bullets, I could probably just blast everything up', well... You can't, trust me when I say that you will run out of bullets fast, specially if you're playing the game in Hard or Survivor. The AI (infected and people) cannot see the AI (Ellie and other partners), unless they spot you, then they will attack Ellie and or the other people you are with. Naughty Dog did this on purpose, because they didn't want your partner/s to get in the way. The Controls feel smother than Uncharted 3's, you cannot, jump to things and climb stuff like Drake can, when you see Joel run, climb etc... you could feel like a heavy feeling, you could tell that he can't do all that stuff that Drake can do, you could tell that he's just another person trying to survive. The atmosphere is perfect, I had Dead Space (the franchise) in first place when it came to that, but The Last Of Us is just so much better. This is an amazing game that everybody should experience, great story, great character development, good graphics, really good mechanics and amazing atmosphere. I recommend 10/10 or 5/5",normal,ps3,2013-06-24,English,1,1,10,train
kyldesty,"There is one really annoying flaw with this game. Whenever you are trying to stealthily hide behind objects to remain obscured from the antagonists, Ellie runs around right in front of them undected! Another flaw is that when Joel has a gun equipped and goes for his melee weapon the gun vanishes into thin air which is stupid. Ok so there is the bad. Everything other than that more than makes up for those flaws. This game has a great story. It is very engaging and paced along superbly. The characters are cool.

bluesoulreaper,"I cannot even to describe The Last of Us without spoiling the story but I'll try my best. The Last of Us isn't a pretty game nor is it fun. It is brutal and realistic when it comes to an apocalyptic world. This just propelled the story even further by giving  an insight to what a true apocalypse is. The story is charged with emotional moments that become more meaningful as the story progresses. The ethical and moral dilemmas are heartbreaking and will put yours beliefs to the test. Naughty Dog truly is a company worth applauding and The Last of Us just further compliments their ability to not only deliver a gaming experience that will dictate the story-telling standards of games to come but also for breaking that boundary. From the prologue to the ending of the game, I bonded with the characters in this apocalypse. The characters that stood out, however, were Ellie and Joel. Ellie is amazing character and even though she has committed some bad deeds she still depicts the one thing that is lost in the game's apocalyptic setting, humanity (other characters show this as well but Ellie holds the most humanity out of them all). Joel, the next main character, is somewhat the opposite but in many moments also shows his angelic side. After suffering an extremely sad and tear-jerking loss, Joel is engulfed in the post-disaster scenario. He continues to survive not live in game; the fact that Joel is older than Ellie clearly indicates that he will be much more violent and ruthless but will survive another day. The game's box art foreshadows the relationship that Joel and Ellie will have. Joel is the most outstanding character when it comes to the mental, ethical, and moral effects that such an apocalypse could have on most people. The graphics are top notch and the environment is very realistic which made me feel like was truly viewing the apocalyptic world through the character's perspective. The gameplay is incredible and terrifying, specially when the Survivor difficulty is unlocked. The only way to stop the gameplay is via the start button. The AI (both friendly and hostile) is superb. The reaction of enemy NPCs depends on your playing style. For example, if an enemy knows you have a loaded gun they will attempt to flank you and become more passive/aggressive. If they don't know you have a weapon than they will most likely charge you (meaning they will be more aggressive) depending on certain factors. The Infected are astonishing is the sense that they truly have one purpose which is to kill you but they aren't your average zombie either. The story as you can tell is beautifully crafted and immersive. The game also offers multiplayer which is an interesting feature but I will not ruin it for you. Overall the game is a masterpiece in aspect that is possible and it undoubtedly deserves a perfect score in my opinion. Naughty Dog thank you for ending the PS3's era with a game that will be the role model of survival games that have yet to come.

ShadowWar,"This game is definitely GOTY. It has everything you want in a survival horror game. First off, it makes you feel scared of everything around the corner. You have limited supplies and you must use good judgement in order to advance to the next level. You can't just rush through this game-you have to think and decide: Do I want to shoot these enemies and risk getting overwhelmed or take my time and use stealth to get through the next section. The graphics are amazing and the storyline is well written. If you are mainly a FPS fan, you may not like this game. But, if you love a great storyline and taking your time to enjoy the scenery and collecting items while figuring how to survive each level from tough and smart enemies-then this is the game for you.

The setting is beautiful and very dark. There will be scenes throughout the game where you would feel uncomfortable, sad and relieved. Everybody you see can die and could really strike you emotionally. Graphically this game looks fantastic, it's probably the best looking game on the PS3 to date. Despite some minor bugs and glitches, that doesn't even ruin the experience. This single-player story of this game would make you want to replay it more than once. But the The Last of Us has more to offer and that is multiplayer. Honestly, the game would still be perfect without multiplayer, but that's not the case here. This multiplayer is unique and requires you to have a different approach on winning. It is very tactical, very fun with friends and unique. The only 2 problems i have with multiplayer is that it lacks map content and game modes. It has a fine number of maps (7) and only 2 game modes. But it has already been confirmed that there will be more multiplayer and single-player content on the way.

I have always had an Xbox...,,I borrowed my brother-in-law's PlayStation 3 for the past week. I heard good reviews about 'The Last Of Us' video game and rented it at red box to give it a whirl. After 1 hour of gameplay I still hated the controller and struggled to learn it but the gameplay was unreal, the only thing I can compare the game to is Half-Life. After 3 days of renting the red box, I had to return the console to my brother-in-law's.. I wanted to finish the game, but not only that I wanted the game. If I could I would re-format my Xbox 360 into a platform that would play this game. I returned the red box, then purchased this game brand spanking new. I played it for a grand total of 14 hours straight, didn't sleep at all for one day just because I was so engulfed into the game, emotionally it was playing my feelings like a puppet, I felt so close to the characters at the end that I feel like I was with them! I beat the game and I usually get all ADHD (I have that) and never pick up a game again after beating it.. But I want to play it over and over again, and I haven't even played multiplayerr yet!,I was going to get an Xbox One, but after playing this game, I now am banking my whole decision on This game alone.

Heimskringla91,"I really do not understand people that review this game and say, ""nothing revolutionary game play wise.""  Yeah, well I haven't played a game that really truly has been ""revolutionary"".  Of course game play gets repetitious, because that's what the game is.  That's what every game is and if you enjoy how the game plays then enjoy it.  I for one, greatly enjoyed the way this game moved and how it played.  I found it to be very smooth and at the same time had some extremely brutal kills.  I also enjoyed that I could either, sneak past enemies or take them on up front.  The mixture of fighting other survivors and fighting infected was a good mix, and offered well in a variety of situations.  It was very enjoyable to plan out my attacks and perhaps my defense.,The story was exceptional, the cast was exceptional, and the setting was exceptional.  I think it would've been awesome to be more open-world but no complaints here because the linear story path was awesome.  I thought that the virus was interesting (especially since it's a real virus that occurs in nature) and I wish that was fleshed out more but everything made sense for the story.,So story, game play, atmosphere, I thought it was all extremely well done and really hope NaughtyDog continues to expand upon this story.,What surprised me the most is the multiplayer.  Wow, I thought when I heard the game had online that it was going to be stupid.  A bunch of Joels running around killing each other.  Thankfully it is not that at all and actually quite entertaining especially when played with a buddy.  Pick either Hunter or Firefly and build up your clan by doing well and winning matches.  It's a cool way to divert from other games and shoot it out against others.  Woot!,My only issue with the game is your friendly AI, during parts where you are basically required to be stealthy they are chatting away and running around.  The enemies do not react (which thank God they do not because a few parts would be atrocious) but I would've liked to see your friends (Ellie, etc.) to be more sneaky and really nail that creepy atmosphere of needing to be silent.

The characters are amazing, Naughty Dog really out done themselves even though they are just characters in a game and we shouldn't care what happens to them and yet I continually find myself in tears or smiling at some scenes. The Last of Us definitely generates a memorable game experience. The music is another one of its good factors, its such an amazing and beautiful soundtrack.,Now I've read most of the reviews and a lot of people seem to give The Last of Us a perfect score, however there are those who give it a low rating. Claiming the game's AIs have flaws, the game play isn't great and the graphics are bad. Some people seem to be forgetting this minor detail. There is no perfect game.  Every game is going to have its flaws, bugs or glitches. Why I gave this game a 9/10 is mostly based on that reason.,There is no perfect game and this game unfortunately has many flaws, but at least believe that The Last of Us deserves a good score. Other gamers may disagree, but that's their choice. They played the game and didn't like it, maybe it wasn't their cup of tea. Everyone has a different way to go about the game. Some will love it, others hate it.  That's what opinions are all about.,I do in fact agree with the rating the critics gave The Last of Us as much as I agree with the User score overall.,The Last of Us is a good game, one of this years best so far. I'd recommend it to anyone with a PS3, some may call this game a ""masterpiece"" others ""Failure"", but that's for you to decide.,Don't base what you see of the game on reviews like this. If you think the game looks good, play it.,Who knows you could very well like the game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-24,English,5,2,9,train

I'll say it's like anything I've played so far. Sure it's another shooter but the the whole crafting thing makes it fun and the upgrades on the spot adds a spice to it.

Foxmann250,"Naughty Dog has been a great studio behind every one of their games.  From Crash Bandicoot, Jak & Daxter, and through their Uncharted series... and now the Last of Us.  I'll be honest, the game is not perfect like many may claim, but what it does do, it does very well.  It puts you on edge and suspense in a creepy yet beautiful future.  The gameplay isn't quick like most games, but slow, allowing you to evaluate each opportunity and how to approach it.  And even the most well thought out plans will fail, and when they do all hell breaks lose.  The acting is top notch, the graphics are pushing the last of what the PS3 has to offer, and the length of the campaign will make you feel like its a long journey... I've run into some graphical glitches, and the slow gameplay is hard to adapt to since I am used to the faster paced Uncharted's they've made, but what it does is different from most games, and that is why it shines above them.  Overall, I'd say I still prefer their Uncharted series, due to the fact that I like the action and humor and walk away from those games feeling good like an action movie should.  All the while when playing the Last of Us, I find myself having to take breaks due to it's emotional and stressful suspenseful nature.  But that is what they were going for, and damn did they do it well.  8/10 only cuz Uncharted 2 gets a 9/10 on my list, and that is the best game I've ever played.

dz9,"To start off this review, I'd like to say that The Last of Us is a very good game.  That being said, it's definitely not the legend people are making it out to be.  In essence it is an excellent game that held back from greatness from a culmination of small but significant flaws.  Knowing NaughtyDog and any of the trailers, it is easy to see that this game is gorgeous, spot on voice acting and motion capturing combined with the atmosphere make this game a visual delicacy.  The gameplay is a simple and familiar one (I can understand the people that can not bare this game because of the familiar stealth), effective and tense in parts, but hair-pulling and repetitive in others.  You pretty much have to play stealth for the majority of your time playing TLoU, fighting your way past zombie-inspired monsters and your fellow human survivors.  The stealth is very simple but overall effective, however when the game gives you the objective to clear all enemies in a given area, it makes the game feel too ""video game-y"" and breaks the immersion it tries so desperately to set up.  Also breaking the immersion is the awful Ai.  For your allies, too often do they get in your way or frantically and aimlessly running in plain sight of the enemy without even somehow being spotted.  For your enemies, the lack of variety of the zombies make getting through them extremely repetitious and the AI for the human foes range from Super Sight, eyes in the back of their head, and unbelievable stupidity.  The human AI is never consistent and too often will your carefully thought out stealth streak be interrupted by the unbearable AI.  The crafting system is a great thought and raises the tense moments of combat even more due to the live action inventory mechanic, only gripe regarding it is the fact is that I never felt constricted to craft items which I should feel in an apocalyptic horror game, because although the ammo felt balanced right, the supplies to make molotovs, nailbombs, and health packs came all too in abundance.  The story although not outstanding, is workable, it gets you from point A to point B effectively while coming up with a few cool ideas along the way.  The best part of the story is the interactions between the characters you'll meet, seeing them evolve as characters and grow before the player's eyes is a narrative treat.,In the End:  The Last of Us sports a decent story, a great and believable cast of characters, outstanding visuals, but lacks depth and consistency in the gameplay especially with in the AI department.,The Last of Us    7.8/10",normal,ps3,2013-06-24,English,3,1,8,train
waterwaterwater,"The last of us is a really entertaining game. The graphics are very well done considering the aging platform it runs on. The storyline is engaging and the sound is immersive. Something that bothered me a lot was Joel taking up too much of the center of the screen. Third person view is fine but I found myself trying to look around the character way to much. Also, why is there so much boxed ammo, food, and scissors laying around 20 years after the end of the world? Why do I have to craft shanks from scissors? Are the scissors not already pointy and sharp? Knives don't exist anymore? Why can I construct a working rifle scope from nuts and bolts? My biggest gripe was the lack of an open world. While the level designers did do a great job, it was a real big immersion breaker being told the only way through a city is to climb up into a leaning skyscraper (ignoring the physics of that) even though that would be the last thing any reasonable person would do. Also, why give the players maps if they are useless? These are all nitpicks I have and do not mean that this is not an awesome title. While the massive amount of ""PERFECT GAME EVERRRR!"" coming from critics and players alike is merely hype I would and am recommending the last of us to my friends.",normal,ps3,2013-06-24,English,0,0,8,train
Funksatron,"The visuals in this game are extremely refined. Top of their class. The gameplay is much less refined. It is essentially a stealth shooter and not a very good one.  My immersion in the game was never very deep because the stealth mechanic was so unconvincingly executed. All enemies are either sensitive to line of sight or the sound of YOUR foot steps or gunshots. How the enemy would know the difference between the foot steps or gunshots of an ally or an enemy isn't explored, but it is of little consequence as nearly every OTHER sound is ignored. Grunts, stabs, clangs, clinks, your allies talking, whistling or yelling. Hell, the enemies don't even see your allies stumbling at their own feet. Also, enemies have infinite ammo, until they die. Then they rarely drop weapons or ammo, and even more rarely of the type they were using to attack you.  The seeing-by-sound system was buggy and sometimes failed to show close enemies or report them in the correct direction.  The story could use more development. The focus is on character relationships, but unfortunately I was never convinced to be on the side of the character that I played. I didn't agree with his values or judgement and did not want him to succeed while exhibiting those values.

angrius,"This game is pretty. That's the best part. Story is ok for modern story telling and especially anything zombie related. Those are the best parts of the game. First disappointing thing I came across was how limiting, linear and predictable environments are. There are no alternative paths. The largest freedom you get is how you stealth around a small room to dispose all the zombies. Since some of the zombies one shot you (which is good), there is no way to just gun through them (maybe i am just a terrible gamer). Another disappointing thing is your little girl buddy. She is not detected by the enemies, so while you are painfully stealthing around she just runs around with the flash light on... right through the zombies. Breaks any submersion. I love zombies, I loved Dishonored, Thief, Deus Ex, Hitman, but this doesn't even come close. I wish this game gave you ability to scope out the area from the distance, gave you a chance to plan your attack (stealth or brute force) and then execute it using available resources or your favorite way, this game has none of that.",normal,ps3,2013-06-24,English,67,9,4,train

SeaOtter,"Okay so I'm going to give my honest review of this game.,,First let's get all the bad things out of the way. There are a bunch of bugs in this game. From disappearing corpses, to dialogue not having sound( This happens rarely and is probably just my blueray giving problems, althoug it's just a week old ps3.). The enemy AI supposedly doesn't notice your companions since then they'd give your position away too often. This is supposedly how they developed it and is not a bug. Really? Okay, I guess that isn't a bug, just  programming then. Because your companion AI is literally dumb as a brick.  Here's an example of my first playthrough.,,I was sneaking past a few clickers in a graveyard, I was tensed the  out because a clicker jumping you meant insta-death. So sneakily sneaked towards a clicker's back and wouldn't you know it, old Bill came stomping his feet so hard, running right in a circle around the fore-mentioned clicker, just to hide in plain sight-next to the clicker. My windows almost broke from the intense amount of sound he was producing. I have to admit, my heart stopped because this is the first time it happened and at least the clicker didn't notice him. (It will happen again don't you worry.) I gathered my strength and proceeded towards the clicker to slash it's throat. But unfortunately for me, Joel's crotch produced friction in his underpants and alerted the clicker to his presence. Killing him instantly.,,Something like that really breaks the immersion.,,Another thing that really irked me was the spawning in of enemies. I found myself in a very emotional part of the game and decided not to induce a firefight. I went in all ninja like and strangled every single last one of the bastards. Just to have five more guys spawn from out of nowhere, when they start surrounding me and move towards my position. They literally force you in to a firefight. At least this doesn't always happen and for the most part you can just sneak past everyone.,,Now there are a bunch of small bugs in the game, which I think should be easily fixable with a patch or two. But for the most part, they're all minor and never really impact the game in a complete and utter negative way. In all honesty, the companion AI isn't even that big of a deal as I made it out to be, at least they don't alert the enemy right? That would've sucked balls.,,Multiplayer has it's fair share of problems as well. Okay, actually I just encountered one. But I'm sure there are more bugs. I joined a game just to have my camera placed at a static location. It wasn't following my character, it was just stuck at the intro of the match. The only fix I had for this was to aim for the whole duration of the match, that's the only way I got the camera to follow my character. (Which I didn't do for an entire match, since it's annoying. I just joined another game.),,Now for the good things. Now, let's start from the beginning.,The intro was brilliantly done, I won't say what happened, just that it's like getting punched in the nads. My eyes were all watery. You know a game's going to blow you away once it does that. But right after the whole intro sequence, I found the beginning section of the game to be rather, underwhelming. Don't get me wrong. The atmosphere was drawing me in, the dialogue was well written, the voice acting top notch and the graphics were phenomenal. Something was just missing. *Que uplifting music* Then comes Ellie, there to brighten your day in this depressing pale world. The relationship between Joel and Ellie will have you emotionally attached to these characters in no time. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll get angry, then you'll cry some more. The story, I will admit is cliche to a degree. Most of it's idea's has been used before, but it feels right. It's been revamped and maybe made even better. Can't go in to too much detail, I don't want to spoil anything of course.,,The atmosphere rakes you in to the world. The sound makes you feel like you're really there. If you hit someone with a blunt object, you can actually hear how hard that thing hits. Guns sound like they pack a punch. Music ques at the right times. The world Naughty Dog has crafted is something you can literally gawk at for hours. It's that beautiful. I found myself staring at the environment more than actually playing the game. The cut-scenes portray character emotions on a whole new level.  Okay so my character limit is almost up.,,Just to recap.,The BAD:,Disappearing corpses.,Glitching AI,Glitching camera in multiplayer,,The GOOD.,Beautiful soundtrack.,Sounds are realistic.,Story is brilliant.,Voice acting is superb.,Replay value.,Enemy AI is smart.,Graphics.,Atmosphere.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,1,1,10,train
Maddness,"The last of us is something very special delivered in videogame form that has to be experienced, no matter what. The moment you start the game you know why. I have played quite a few games in my 35 years of existence, and this one is by far the best experience i have had in games. Everything in game just screams seriously high production values. The animation, the voice actors, storyline, everything is just way beyond and above of what one would expect of a game. Lets take the voice actors for example. Joel, voiced by Troy Baker, and Ellie, voiced by Ashley Johnson are simply amazing. They take their trade very serious, and you can hear it in every line they speak. The chemistry between the two is also something you rarely see in games. The way they grow and bond with each other is simply beautiful. Also, the ""infected"" are done in way you rarely, if at all hear in games. They don't go with the stereotypical zombie cow moans, but instead sound like real sick people in complete pain and agony.,All this doesn't mean nothing of course if the rest of the game doesn't deliver, and rest assured, it does. The animations in this game are so lifelike it is crazy. Little things such as a little nod when Joel agrees with something, or when Ellie looks away in a dreamlike trance (the world as we know it is just an abstract idea to her, what little she knows comes from books, stories etc) when talking about how things were before the world went to crap really ad up.,Graphics are outstanding, and probably the finest you see on the PS3, but then again this beast of a game from Naughty Dog, so it was to be expected. Everything, from the ruined cities, to the characters is done in amazing, lifelike detail.,Story is done very well. It is a little cliche at times, but despite that it is a story well worth experiencing.,and last, but not least, game play.,Game play is a delight in this game. Bullets feel like they really hit a enemy. It has this heavy feel to it when they find their target. Another small detail in the gunplay is that when you go out of bullets against bandits or soldiers and continue to pull the trigger your gun makes this empty clicking sound. Nothing special about that, but the enemy hears this too. I was stunned to see a guy behind cover slightly rise from behind cover and surveying the situation and then said to another guy ""he's out, lets f him up"". That was crazy realistic and even though my behind was served to me on a silver platter, i could not help myself smiling. Only small problem in my opinion is that some guys can take a few too many bullets and that can distract from the illusion.Small problem mind you, but a problem nonetheless. Hand to hand and melee is also something not for those with a weak heart. It feels brutal and animalistic. Really the primal him or me feeling. And when Ellie comments after a fight with something like ""geez Joel, what the F?"" you wonder exactly who the monster was in this fight.,So yea, this game is most certainly worth playing, even if you don't own a PS3. Borrow it from a friend or something, but make sure you experience it. There is nothing out there quite like it. It makes you smile, it makes you cry, it makes you despair and it makes you hope. 10/10",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,5,4,10,train
f_type,"Games that take place in a post-apocalyptic world and games about zombies are pretty common these days. It may be easy to write off The Last of Us as another zombie apocalypse game but it is much more than that. The story revolves around the outbreak of a mysterious fungus that infects humans and turns them into violent zombies (called the “Infected” but same premise). The pandemic has resulted in the decimation of humanity as we know it. Twenty years after the outbreak, civilized society has deteriorated and the world has become a dangerous place. Various zombies stalk the land and threaten all living beings. The few remaining humans are forced to choose between being imprisoned into militarized quarantine zones for safety or live on the outside and fight for their survival by any means necessary. There are no morals in this world. As Joel, your job will be to survive the chaotic world and escort a young girl name Ellie to a group of rebels. (Luckily, Ellie is not the typical escort victim and almost always takes care of herself and even helps Joel.) The two make an odd pair but the evolution of their bond is one of the most captivating things about the game. The story, delivered by some fantastic voice actors and cinematic cut-scenes, paints a ruthless future for mankind. Due to the nature of the world, the gameplay revolves around the concept of survival. It is an unforgiving world and you will need to fight strategically if you want to live. Supplies are scare and dangers are plentiful. This is one a game where ""run and gun"" rarely works and stealth plays a very important role. The combat is tense and unforgiving at first, but you will be eased into it in the early stages. It is a satisfying experience once you get the hang of it. A notable aspect of combat is that enemies are completely oblivious to your companions when they run within enemy sight or make audible noise. This was a development design to prevent frustrations from poor AI, though it does hurt the immersion a bit. Visually, the game is arguably one of the best looking console games ever made and is complimented by a minimalistic but atmospheric soundtrack. Exploring the beautiful, decayed world reveals the stories of a once thriving population now on the brink of extinction. There are some minor graphical glitches and a few rare instances of missing sound effects, but these flaws are easily ignorable. Taken as a whole, the game paints a brutally honest and realistic post-apocalyptic future for mankind. It is an engrossing adventure and one where you will feel a range of emotions. From the chaotic introduction to the dark ending, The Last of Us draws you in and sends you on a brutal, thought provoking adventure that leaves its mark on the player.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,13,9,10,train

Ellie, who was born after the outbreak, is in a strange world and often likes to hear about how it used to be her surprise at random stories of the past may just have you questioning your own life and what has been forgotten.,Taking place across a year, we witness the various seasons and beautiful landscapes and cities that Naughty Dog has created for our two heroes, whatever diverse and rich environment you are in for a particular part of the story, be sure to explore it, simply for the fact that supplies and ammunition are low throughout the game, where choices have to be made in terms of what you can carry and and what you may need to carry.,As a story, The Last of Us is a true benchmark not only in game storytelling, but in a literary sense it is near perfect. These creatures that attack you are never brushed off with rock music to show any valour in our characters, they realise that these are still people, but of course these infected are a force to be reckoned with, a group called Clickers may just have you being sleepless for a while, these ones have got the worst of the infection, and while they cannot see, the slightest noise you make will alert them and have them chasing you endlessly, the name of them deriving from the sound they make, one of the most dreaded sounds in the game, because not matter what age you may be, this is a frightening and emotionally draining story from start to finish, whether you have to somehow sneak or fight your way through a band of infected, or if your only source of light is a torch clipped to your chest, these are some of the best but most frightening pieces of the game.,The creators have proved once again that an amount of care and sympathy can be felt for video game characters, Joel and Ellie are the most unlikely duo with the biggest task at hand, and each and every time one of them hit any trouble, there is despair to be felt in case any harm should come to them, we laugh and perhaps cry with them, Ellie isn't able to swim and Joel must go and find something to help her cross, its the little things that give us so much from these characters, a remarkable feat from the makers, they know how bad they have it, and now we must share their pain, with the limited ammo that we have.,No analysis of multiplayer, I have yet to play it, but for what the game is created for, the story, this is a truly wondrous  and phenomenal stroke of genius and creative mastery, an epic tale of survival, loyalty, willpower, loneliness but most of all, friendship. The game is truly breathtaking and will undoubtedly stand the test of time and should deservedly be on everyone's list as one of the best games ever created, because it will certainly not be a forgettable experience.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,6,4,10,train

Parag0N,A perfect 10! What else needs to be said about this masterpiece...This is the first game that had such an emotional impact on me that I found myself tear up twice throughout the campaign.  If you want to see what a team at the absolute top of their game can produce check out Naughty Dog's masterwork. It's probably the most amazing game of this entire generation.  Multiplayer is a nice mix of uncharted and gears of war and is extremely fun to play.

simongeist,"I for one, thought that this game was everything I expected it to be. It doesn't matter how good something is, there are those who will find fault with anything. For those complaining about the graphics- what the Hell were you playing it on? I thought it had excellent graphics. The story was well written and the characters were all hardened by their surroundings, but still managed to show the kind of emotion void in survival games. The problem with gaming is everyone has been spoiled with games that cater to the run and gun style. When games come along that actually make you slow down, and have to make a choice with limited ammo, limited resources, and limited options, it seems either some cannot grasp this concept and  or they adapt. Just like real life. No game is true to life, especially military shooters. Being a former Marine, I play some of these but find myself amused by the comments of some gamers make in regards to ""if they were in that situation"". Funny. I really found the pace of The Last of Us to be somewhat truer to form if things were catastrophic. I have played alot of games, and truly have to say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. I felt that Naughty Dog really captured the moments that were important very well. There were parts of the game that made you feel the torment of the character, and parts that made you want to kill. I play both Xbox and PS3, and I really and truly have to say that Naughty Dog has made another epic game that I can only find on my PS3, which has become the norm. If you truly love gaming, not just running around like an idiot, enjoy a game with depth and story, want more than the ""typical"" game that has been offered up as of late, then I highly recommend this game for you. If not, then expand your mind a little. Their are moments in this game that would make most feel sad or moved somewhat. It was nice to feel something for the characters and seeing their torment and very few highs in a desolate world  I really hope that more developers will push themselves the way this company has to make a superior product. Their is no excuse in 2013 for some of the crap being put out. This game should be a benchmark for what can be done if certain elements are combined. Making a survival game that clearly stands above others (Walking Dead was great as well)  Naughty Dog proved that making a great game with all the aspects in the survival genre could be done.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,2,1,10,train

The developers that brought us the Uncharted franchise have shifted their creative focus from the ""Summer-Blockbuster"" style of adventure game, instead bringing us a dark, grisly and very humanistic tale of loss and survival.

This game is best played on hard mode (to maximise survival horror aspect),2. Tun OFF the hearing feature that lets you ""see"" through walls (as above),3. There are a couple of glitch type bugs but no gamebreakers,,Apart from that, this game is as good as it gets, as intense and scary as Dead Space (in parts), the combat and stealth are slick and well-ballanced, and the environments are drop dead gorgeous.,,You owe it to yourself to play this game.,,Enjoy!",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,2,1,10,test
jlplatten,"After playing games on every system since Atari, this will go down as my favorite game of all time. This isn't a mindless action packed shoot em' up game. It plays more like Metal Gear Solid  Splinter Cell, where you're forced to stealth around to take out your enemies individually rather then go guns blazing. If you don't strategize your approach, you'll surely die. The ammo and weapons you have are limited, so you have to play smart. I only played on normal, and I plan to replay it on survival mode where the supplies are even further limited.,,This game is also scary. It kind of brings me back to what Resident Evil used to be. All about survival, and being scared to explore new rooms. The zombies are referred to as infected, and they're not your traditional zombies (dead coming back to life and you have to kill the brain). They are more like zombies from 28 Days Later. Just regular humans who get a disease and turn crazy in a matter of minutes. Also, the infected have different phases (based on how long they've been infected), which allows for a variety in characteristics and different means of dispatching. Nothing worse than getting the attention of one infected who wakes up all their nearby friends. You can go from focused to panic in a matter of seconds.,,The game play and feel of the game is a good blend between MGS and Resident Evil (both in my top 10), which I already stated. But what really puts this game over the top for me are two things: the lack of repetition in the fight sequences and the best story telling ever made in a video game. First, I say lack of repetition because every fight scene feels unique. Your environment plays a huge part on how you kill enemies, and there's not a single piece of landscape, building, or road that is reused. Also, you have so many different means of killing enemies using firearms, bow and arrows, smoke grenades, make-shift bombs, molotov  knives, blunt objects, choke holds or hand-to-hand combat. Second, the best story telling every! I've never felt so invested in two video game characters than Joel and Ellie. The actors they casted for the voices did an amazing job. Also the dialogue between all the characters felt so genuine. Most of the story telling were done with cut scenes, but how they depicted the movement, gestures and facial expressions of these characters, on top of the incredible voice acting, made everything feel real. Sometimes I forgot I was playing a video game.,,Best game ever. I can't wait to play it again!",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,2,1,10,test

shaun8pickles,"I have got to start off this review by giving a big round of applause for Naughty Dog on yet another great hit, if not amazing. I have to say this is the best game I have played in years, and that's saying a lot with all the games I play. This games story is brilliant, sad, happy, depressing, gross, and somehow pulls all that off. There's nothing here I can say that pulled me away from the experience. Aside from a few visual glitches (arms through bodies, people stuck inside stairs), this games pulls everything together and makes it one of the best games ever made. The shooting mechanics are great, the lack of ammo in the world really adds  to the feeling of hopelessness, the letters you find in the game world really put you in someones else's shoes and shows a bit of back story. The prologue of the game was the hook that really pulls you in, and kept me playing for the next 3-4 hours. Also I was absolutely amazed at the graphics in this game, coming from Naughty Dog you already have high expectations and the graphics blew me away. The coolest thing about it is that the load times are so minimal (I have the digital edition, which may make a difference in load times) and the game seamlessly blends cut scenes and action or cut scenes and drama. I also loved the way the characters reacted with each other, there is some really good humor in this game to bring you away from destruction for a bit. I loved the environments in this game, how vines grew up on buildings years old, or travelling through tunnels full of poisonous spores.

monosyllabical,"This year has seen an incredible spike in the quality of videogame storytelling (and GTA 5 is still to come, as well as Beyond: Two Souls). PC gamers have enjoyed strong, narrative-driven games for decades, while console games have generally languished in a gameplay-first, story-second mentality (not an inherently bad ideology, but not one that exactly encourages the pillars of storytelling) during that same period. There have been great stories on console for sure, but the consistency and ingenuity as of late has been unprecedented, and so very welcome. The Last of Us marries gameplay and story in such a way as to set the benchmark for the next generation. This is how you do it. Naughty Dog has taken the framework of the Uncharted franchise, gameplay-wise, and stripped it of its' wild acrobatics and treasure-hunting in favor of grueling survival and supply-scavenging. This ever-present struggle fuels the emotionally-charged, tense, and unforgettable story of two survivors amidst a world gone mad, a story that at times shocks, inspires awe, and breaks your heart. The seamless in and out between gameplay and story, the pitch-perfect pacing, is something that could only be achieved by a studio at the height of its' ability, and the freedom to do so. Sony and Naughty Dog deserve many accolades for this achievement. The game isn't perfect (the enemy AI, which seems to be a common gripe, is a bit simple, and their ignorance of your companions is both bizarre and disappointing, but I still ended up dying 70 times on Hard, so maybe I should be grateful), but the resounding successes of the game bury deep any minor qualms. Furthermore, the multiplayer, which carries over nicely from the main game and features a surprisingly addictive metagame, is a fantastic bonus that only serves to bury deeper still those tiny, insignificant misgivings. I strongly encourage anyone to play this, as long as you can stomache the violence and themes, and judge for yourself. For a game about what could be the end of the world, it makes me look forward to the future of gaming.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,2,1,10,train
kizzyr,"I rarely pre-order any game, but after seeing trailers of this game, I just had to pre-order it. I must say, I was not disappointed with my decision at all. The game is extremely immersive and drew me in right from the very start. I finished it in one day as I could not put the controller down.,,I find the environment design in the game very ground-breaking. The post-apocalyptic world in the game is so beautiful and realistic. What is the most exceptional though is the facial expressions of all characters, particularly Joel and Ellie's. Add exceptional voice-acting to that and I began to care about these characters a lot.,,The gameplay mechanic is very well implemented. No 'encounter' with enemies is the same given that there are three main types of enemies: the soldiers, the survivors (who are either part of the Hunters or the Fireflies) and of course the mutated. The layout in each encounter is different and makes me think hard about how to best approach these enemies (of course given the amount of resources I have left).,,Now, the ending (spoiler-free) is what really left a lasting impression on me. I have been thinking for days about the ending... The way the game has allowed the relationship between Joel and Ellie to develop strongly reinforced the ending, which has also sparked quite a bit of debate on the Internet.,,If you have a PS3 (even if you don't), I highly recommend this game to you.

OpinionatedMan,"A good game for certain, a very good one in fact. But it is not the earth shattering 7th generation masterpiece it has been hailed. There are three flaws to the game, two (which I will start with) are minor: The depth in the game is pretty bad in my opinion, 7 guns is pretty stingy, especially considering you get one in the last mission. And if you want to nitpick you can reduce the usable number to 5, the revolver and hand shotgun are useless when compared to El Diablo and the magazine based pistol. The reason this is not a massive issue is due to the very short length of the game (which ties into the depth complaint). I clocked in at 11 hours, and that is with struggling mightily on two sections. I suppose you can argue that they didn't want the gameplay to get get stale, but if you give the fighting more variety (get a bowie knife sometime? what about getting to keep that sniper rifle used in the suburbs mission? The hunting rifle hardly fills the sniper category.) Then you can expand some on their journey across the Midwest, you could have a cool Midwest level in St. Louis or Chicago. The last complaint regarding the depth is the lack of variety of enemies, you only have 3 types of zombies, that is just a poor showing. You could add a zombie type that crawls on the ceilings, and when you are in dark areas they could pounce on you, that would both add a lot more tensions and increase the variety. There are many other things you could have done with the enemies that Naughty Dog neglected to do. My second complaint is the fights. They are formulaic, predictable, and rather uninspired at times. When this game was announced I dreamed of a mission where you have to fight your way through abandoned areas fighting BOTH infected and enemies at the same time, something unheard of in gaming. Instead you only fight one or the other, which is not nearly as exciting. Imagine the chaos in a fight where you are popping shots at bandits and then a group of clickers into the fray, this makes it difficult to continue the gunfight while dealing the powerful, but blind clickers. Little things like that would've prevented the gameplay from dragging the game down. The third complaint has spoilers so don't read and further if you don't want to know the ending. My third complaint is Joel's decision to save Ellie. What the  was that? I realize that it was supposed to show how attached he was to Ellie but Naughty Dog does nothing to morally justify his decision to annihilate the FireFlies and then proceed to lie to her about how things went down. All he does in retort to Marlene's explanation about why it is important to kill her is ""That's all  but does nothing to extrapolate. Why? Because Marlene is probably right, ultimately killing Ellie is the better thing to do, ESPECIALLY since Ellie is so selfless, which is why Joel lies to her, because he knows that should would be infuriated with him if he had told her the truth. Thus, in my mind, their relationship post game is based on a lie and is artificial. This is the only major complaint because this game was always based on the story, which is why I am not too upset with them forsaking the gameplay some. The game really is very good, the story does a fantastic job building the relationship, making sure that none of the emotions felt between Ellie and Joel is forced. Which is ultimately why the game is still a 9, because the main component of the game, the story, is fantastic until the last 15 minutes.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,1,0,9,train
Youngmoney9745,"This game is purely outstanding and has one of the most realistic game playing feelings compared to other survival games. Amazing graphics, gameplay mechanics, voice acting and really has a similar Uncharted feel to it. I like how you can explore almost anywhere you please for items or ammo or collectibles and etc. Ellie is a cool partner to have along the way, but honestly she isn't as helpful as you would think in close combat situations, you are pretty much doing all the work, but hey thats what games are for right, it would be boring just to see your partner do everything. Plus there is the occasional glitch with surroundings and enemies every once in a while, for example I was sneaking up on an enemy aware of my presence, and when I got really close to him, he disappeared and was far behind me, I suggest the game might need an update. Ignore all of that, and you have an amazing story followed but many intense moments and an almost realistic looking plot line to follow it, The multiplayer is really creative, I think in opinion it has a Mass Effect feel with all the factions to go around it.

thatmattkid,"The story of The Last of Us is one that has definitely been told many times before, but its deep character development and constant questioning of what is morally right and wrong are what make this tale truly stand out from the group.,,Many things I enjoyed about the game have already been mentioned numerous times before by different reviewers so I will focus on what I think many have overlooked. Firstly the voice acting of Troy Baker (Joel) and Ashley Johnson (Ellie) is phenomenal; in fact one of the reasons it may have been so overlooked is purely for how natural and believable it is. Despite working out of a white walled studio whilst wearing motion capture suits, they still obtain a grasp and understanding about the desolate world they're living better than some Hollywood actors.,,Another feature I'd like to take a minute to talk about is the online multiplayer, which manages to emulate the tension and ferocity from the single player campaign and apply it into a competitive format. There are two modes: death match and a single life survivor match both of which you play to find supplies and complete challenges to keep your clan healthy and bring in my members. If you chose to synch it to your Facebook account your clan members consist of your Facebook friends and family which makes it even more relatable and disappointing when you fail to protect or provide for them.

Vampgamereviews,"MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS**,,I for one was looking forward to the 'The last of us' since I first heard it was being made. I was hoping for a 3rd person survival game, I didn't get that however I did get an enjoyable romp through zombie land. Let’s get to the review.,,To begin, I'll start with is this worth the price and should you get it?,,Pros  Good if predictable story,- Strong characterisation,- Great setting,-  Look beautiful,,Cons  game play can be a bit lacking,- Soundtrack is very forgettable,,Is it worth the price tag? No, you should probably wait for it to drop if you're on the fence about buying it.,Is it worth playing? Sure is, If you don't mind the price tag then go get it now,,Now into the meat.,,Story -,The story is pretty well done even for being predictable, the characters seem really and have great personalities. The evolution of Joel and Ellies relationship while it was predictable came off as very real. The pacing was very good, I never once felt like I was rushed along and I only was puzzled by one moment at the start of the winter chapter. The atmosphere is great, especially when sneaking around clickers, you’re waiting to strike first in case they sense you and you’re always waiting for the next attack. One thing that I was hoping for and didn't get was multiple endings, I was hoping to choose what happened at the end but this is really only a nitpick,,Sound -,While the sound effects do their job and so does the music, they don't stand out except for the clickers click. The music is forgettable and I highly doubt you'll find yourself humming it in the shower.,,Graphics -,Wow, they did a great job on the graphics especially the cut scenes which look perfect, I haven't seen quality like this since square. Only one small complaint comes in this section and that is the brown leaves on the ground in winter when look very flat and one of place.,,Gameplay -,For me this is when the game starts to suffer, let’s get the pros out of the way. The upgrade system while basic works very well in showing the improvement of the character and guns, its also very easy to grasp. Close combat feels great, I love how it’s looks to smash someone in the face or hit them with an axe and finally stealthing around works for the most part and is very easy to pick up. The cons are cons that I had with the uncharted engine itself, guys take too many shots to kill and act like you just shot them with a stun gun instead of a bullet making long range follow up shots stupidly annoying to hit with. Aiming takes way to long in comparison to the enemies and they have unlimited ammo which really takes you out of the atmosphere of the game. Most of the game I spent throwing bricks and running up and snapping the guys neck than shooting. There is one really strange boss fight that breaks all the rules fighting the enemy type that he is and you can always tell when a big battle is coming up by how much ammo you're getting. The mandatory battle are really annoying too, while you can stealth some of them, most you can't or is very hard and I feel its a way to make you use your hard earned ammo and bombs up. I would have preferred them take the mandatory battles away and not have been as generous with ammo, health packs and crafting items.,,Overall with my complaints aside, the game is a solid experience and why can't we enjoy a predictable story if it’s told well? It certainly a contender for the best released title so far however it is not god’s gift to gaming, it will not change the face of gaming or storytelling. It’s just a good game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,0,0,8,test
bullogna,"For our full review, visit b-ten.com/the-last-of-us-review/,,Gameplay,,The gameplay, I’d say, is probably the weakest aspect of this, overall, powerful game. While stealth combat continued to peak my interest throughout my first play-through of the game, many action-based scenes became redundant and attempting to progress towards the next cut-scene felt as if it were to take ages. Naughty Dog certainly improved the repetitive gameplay mechanics found in Uncharted 3, but clearly interactivity was not a priority in this critically-acclaimed intellectual property.,,Some chapters would require players to quietly take out a number of enemies using stealth, while others would focus more on direct combat. Some even required that players use a variety of both. If one thing’s for certain, though, it’s the fact that resources, throughout the game’s entirety were limited. Players are left scavenging for more guns, ammunition, shivs, med kits, and crafting materials used to create materials when all remaining hope of survival seems lost.,,The infected added an unusual sense of survival horror to this third-person action game which I felt was enforced perfectly. The horror elements found within the game aren’t too daunting for players accustomed to less frightening action games, but also aren’t too subtle for those with an appetite for fear. The clickers, being the most reputable of the infected, live up to the expectations in which they too must be approached using stealth and creativity on the player’s end. The runners are easily defeated with melee weapons, such as a knife, baseball bat, or my personal favorite: an axe. And finally, the bloaters being the most challenging infected seem to only take offense by distance weapons when first set fire to by a Molotov  or perhaps a flamethrower.,,Overall, the gameplay featured in The Last of Us was aspiring, but weak in comparison to other games which resemble this one. Much of the repetitiveness in reoccurring player deaths seems futile, but is easily overshadowed by the underlying drama found within the story’s context. Naughty Dog is a profoundly celebrated developer, resulting in expectations rising with each new release. The Last of Us’ gameplay accentuates impressive ideas, easily meeting my expectations, but failing to exceed them.,,Story,,Completely disregarding all similarities The Last of Us shares with other media, its story is flawless. With each cut-scene, new emotions are evoked and with that in mind, new thought are provoked. Without spoiling major plot-points, the game brings many improved elements to the Naughty Dog universe and refreshes a genre which, to me, was beginning to annoy me to no end.,,Sharing nearly seamless similarities with Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, while also sharing influences with The Walking Dead and I Am Legend, the premise of The Last of Us is doubtlessly no foreign concept to those who have played it, but sparks new life in its unquestionable focus on character empathy, relationships, and the importance of life. Thematically, the game offers an array of new ideas, but does so in a way that feels fragmented at points.,,With each segment of gameplay leading to a new piece of the story’s puzzle, one would imagine Naughty Dog, of all developers, could realize by now the importance of seamlessly integrating story with interaction. Irrational Games successfully proved with the Bioshock series that narrative in video games doesn’t require a complete pause in gameplay to successfully carry a point across. This is where The Last of Us fails. The gameplay and cut-scenes found within the game felt as though I was consuming two different products. I was playing a video game, while being surprisingly interrupted by glorious cinematic features.,,While I’ll let it slide by this time, as I have with each of Naughty Dog’s previous installments, due to their knack for storytelling, at some point the developer needs to begin to grasp the concept of seamless storytelling integration without the need for gameplay interruption.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,0,0,8,train
Conchvegas,"The Last of Us, a PS3 exclusive is being touted as one of the best games...ever. That’s high praise for what is essentially a zombie killing spree. In a nutshell, it focuses on a rugged survivor in a post apocalyptic world tasked with escorting a fourteen yr. old girl. The girl who is immune to the spores which has turned most of mankind into walking fungal diseases, needs to be taken to someone, somewhere who can turn her blood into a cure.,Where this game shines is it’s graphics. Video games have been leapfrogging each other over the years to perfect their graphics and The Last of Us has reached the pinnacle, so to speak. Photo-realism is the best descriptor. It’s like you’re playing masterpiece painting within a movie. In a lot of games, the cut scenes are of a better quality than the game play graphics. In the Last of Us, they are on par.,The acting doesn’t disappoint either. The characters obviously modeled on real people are pitch perfect with their voices, and great pains are taken to capture facial expressions down to a tic.,It is one of the more profane games I’ve played. Anywhere they can throw a curse word in, they do, which means it’s strictly late night playing with my impressionable six year around.,The action is visceral, especially in hand to hand combat and easy with one melee button and no complicated combos. The guns leave something to be desired with their spotty aiming and bullets which seem to have no effect on adversaries until the fifth or sixth one. Given that you have realistic, limited ammo this is a drawback. However well the game has been promoting the fact that finding said ammo is quite difficult to find, I haven’t run out yet, as it is a bit more plentiful than suggested. Stealth is the suggested mode of combat, and works well until you are right up behind an enemy or beside him, and the button you’re supposed to press for surprise attack simply does not...work.,,Exploring the world is fun as you are constantly on the hunt for ingredients for Molotov  medkits, and shivs. You are often tasked with finding hidden ways out of a particular place which after a little searching is rewarding.,The touted variety of the world  well beautiful and grim can get repetitious. Forest, abandoned city/town, forest...you get the idea.,Save points are generous in that well you may die quite a few times before clearing a certain area, it doesn’t set you back too far after restarting, but lets you complete the particular action piece from approximately where you died until you manage to survive. The only complaint I have is that where stealth is the suggested course of action, it often turns into a close quarters melee battle through no fault of your own and often the only way to kill all your enemies is one-two punching your way through. When stealth does work, however, it is very rewarding.,From what I’ve played so far, it is stellar game but it doesn’t quite deserve the rave 10 out 10 reviews it’s been getting. I’ll give it a 8 out of 10 with a more complete review coming once I’ve finished the game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-23,English,0,0,8,train

triquitrin,"Uncharted meets The Walking Dead meets The Road. The Last of Us is a good game, but it is one undeserving of the 10/10 scores it's been getting. I read it being described as ""The Citizen Kane of videogames""; if this is the best we can expect, the future does indeed look mediocre. Nothing revolutionary here. Writing is really good, the story is not original but it's very well delivered, it makes you feel a strong connection to the main characters, voice acting is stunning and I've fallen in love with the amazing soundtrack. If it were a film, I'd have liked it more, but it's supposed to be a game, and that's where problems begin: repetitive, very repetitive, very very repetitive Uncharted-style gameplay (shoot, explore, shoot some more... whenever you see cover, you know what's about to come; once you're done with the enemies in the area, you know nobody will show up for a while and then it's the time to check every corner for a million pointless collectibles or to complete once again one of the three available puzzles without being disturbed), glitches and bugs that break the immersion in the most painful ways, stupid IA and linear progression.

LoneDutyer,"God damn it, The Last of Us™ is not only criminally overrated, but an actively bad game. The plot is bereft of any innovation, and is advanced only by long, LONG cutscenes which lead to MASSIVE 'cinematic' walking/running from point A to point B, stopping only to shift the occasional ladder or mash buttons in unfun quicktime events. This part of the gameplay (which essentially amounts to poorly rendered cutscenes and is obvious filler) is only broken up by further cutscenes or sudden outbreaks of chest-high walls, which precipitate another tedious bout of the game's stiff, unresponsive and awkward third-person shooter aspect.,,Do you see all the perfect scores this overblown, poorly designed travesty got?

potatoes351,"The Last of Us shows the world that gaming is as legitimate an entertainment form as any other medium, it defines its genre of action-adventure and it is also the biggest reason to own a PS3 if you dont already.,20 years ago a fungal infection spread across the world, killing most of the human race. Now in the year 2033 the USA is governed by a security force who have herded survivors into quarantine zones, they are ruthless and will dish out punishment with extreme prejudice. An underground movement known as the Fireflies is rebelling against them and you, a middle aged man named Joel, are tasked with assisting them in escorting a young girl named Ellie across the country for she holds the cure to the virus that has plagued the world for 20 years.,The story takes place over roughly a year and shows how Joel & Ellie's relationship changes from two people who are stuck with each other to that of a Father and Daughter scenario. This brings in some great plotlines usually revolving around concepts such as life and death or survival.,The graphical standard of TLoU is simply mind-blowing, this is probably the best looking PS3 game ever made, from the lighting to the motion capture and textures, everything is utterly beautiful in TLoU.,The multiplayer is also fun and doesn't compromise the main storylines quality.,In short TLoU is a 12-15 hour thrill ride. If Telltale's The Walking Dead and Resident Evil 4 had a baby (whilst Uncharted was briefly involved for a threesome) this would be it.

MDG397,"As of this moment this is my game of the generation, The Last of Us has a fantastic story and fantastic gameplay, cinematics, voice acting, music, and graphics to back it up. The story is made much better because of the way that the game presents it, the voice acting is perfect and the cinematics make it feel like you're watching a movie. I won't go into detail of the story at all because it's better to find out yourself. All I'll say is that it's the most realistic portrayal of the struggles and horror of a post apocalyptic world that I've ever seen. The gameplay is also really great, it's mostly a stealth game when it comes to gameplay, but you can approach a situation in any way you like. You can try to stay undetected or you can run around and just shoot everybody. It's a lot easier and much more satisfactory and rewarding to play it with stealth though. You can get many different guns and types of equipment to help you through the game, like molotovs and bombs that explode when an enemy gets near it. Equipment like that really allows you to play the way that you want to and it creates a lot of variation in the gameplay. You can craft equipment with supplies that you pick up throughout the game, and it's a really useful feature. Throughout the game you will also find supplements that Joel, the main playable character, can use to upgrade himself with things like more health and crafting speed. There's a similar thing that you can do to weapons, but you have to be at a crafting table to upgrade weapons, you can upgrade Joel anywhere in the game. I'll say that The Last of Us has the best graphics on any current generation console, the textures, the lighting effects, the water effects, the landscapes, and the environments all look perfect. Some of the landscapes are even some of the most beautiful landscapes that I've ever seen in a video game. Each environment creates just the right atmosphere for what's happening, there's never one that doesn't belong. The Last of Us also has multiplayer, and it's a surprisingly fun multiplayer experience. It has a very interesting concept in which you join one of two factions from the single player mode and you ""collect supplies"" from the enemies that you kill and your faction will gain more followers. If you fail to collect enough supplies, your faction members will become hungry, sick, and may die. The whole faction system gives the multiplayer a lot more replayability. Overall, The Last of Us is undoubtedly one of the best games of the generation and one of the best of all time, there's not a single moment in the game that's forgettable. The Last of Us delivers one of the most beautifully presented stories in a video game and has fantastic gameplay, every person who likes video games should play it.",normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,2,1,10,train

You will contemplate the characters and the events of the game after the game has indeed ended, Further proof it is 'good,' it continually forces upon you a suspension of disbelief; and this speaks to its realism in that you will use it a comparison to real life possibility. Mario does not have this effect, therefor it doesn't transcend being a video game, like the Last of Us, which is more accurately described as a great entertainment experience. It melds the positives of more narrative-based entertainment mediums with a form of active entertainment, a video game, allowing for further immersion and involvement than a passive form of entertainment, like a good book, even.,,speaking to the games characteristics, you have freckles/scars/moles, but probably would prefer to focus on your redeeming qualities out of respect. i acknowledge nothing is perfect, this game included. i still rated it a 10 because it is a powerhouse of effort. this was a human creation that came from a place of love, real work and effort are evident through and through.,,- Looting is absolutely rewarding and thrilling, given the scant amount of resources. this blends an organic expository supporting detail throughout the game with a sensible and Rewarding gameplay mechanic.,,- the notes and diaries are emotionally evocative. and here's the kicker; you'll kill some clickers and runners, then look around at the disheveled space you're in. you'll read a note and feel sad for those who died, then feel doubly sad when you realize the victims weren't always spirited away, but sometimes they were the very same clicker or runner you killed.,,- the somber tone of the game was intended, and was quite successfully established and maintained, meaning the narrative hit the mark perfectly. life is not always happy, even without a mushroom apocalypse. certain moments offer a reprieve however, showing hope, in any circumstances, just like in real life. it can't rain all the time, as they say.,,- listen mode should be turned off. plain and simple. you'll feel real tension not knowing what (if anything) is in the next room.,,- the game is wonderful to look at. the world, despite all the death, lives and breathes, you want to explore it all and see what there is to see, this graphical fidelity lends to the immersion and the feeling of ""i want more time with this game, to see all the pretty stuff!"",,- the characters seem real, they are not perfect heroes, at times you might find Ellie annoying, but this IS a fourteen year old child, maybe it just shows i'm getting old that i found her humming music and making guitar noises annoying in the midst of humanity's fall and vicious monster attacks.

koachy92,"The story telling of Naughty Dog has always been on par or better with their productions in the past, be it Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, and especially Uncharted, they always illustrated their characters actions and dialog to match the character in question and appeal to the audience they are trying to engage. In The Last of Us they hold true to that sentiment and take it to an unbelievable level of storytelling genius, getting you emotionally attached to every character they portray which adds to the immersion process the game conveys. There is something that sets this game apart and on a different level from even the Uncharted series. The pure emotion set into each character, and the dialog used by the writers makes for a storytelling extravaganza. It took at least an hour or two for me to get connected with Drake, but Joel and all his companions that you fight with and escort immediately show a sense of realism in emotion and dialog in contrast to the landscape and feel of the game play that let you get emotionally attached to them right when said character is introduced. I believe Naughty Dog only intends on getting better with each IP they release. The experiences they give us are some of the best I've ever encountered while playing video games.

Every aspect of the game was made either flawless or mighty close to it. AI and the combat system were extremely realistic, while still fun and challenging at the same time. However, the main gem of this masterpiece is the story. It's not often you can play with so much emotional connection between the player and the characters. After one finishes the game, you're left with a great feeling and many thoughts, almost like after reading a really good novel. As for me, it took around 3 more days to really process the plot.

MShadows17,"Every now and again, a game comes around that gets all kinds of critical acclaim. Many are naturally drawn to the game in hopes of seeing whether or not the game lives up to the massive amounts of hype that it gets. ""The Last of Us"" is one of those games, and I am proud to say that it lives up to that hype. Naughty Dog, the makers of the critically acclaimed ""Uncharted"" series and the cult favorite ""Crash Bandicoot"" series, doesn't pull any punches in this gritty, violent, post-apocalyptic thriller. The best way to describe the game is that it contains the exploration and action elements of the ""Uncharted"" series with the stealth and story-telling elements of the ""Metal Gear Solid"" series with the scrounging and weapon conservation elements of survival horror. The graphics are top-notch, the scenery is breathtaking, the storytelling and character development is very compelling, the combat is both satisfying and challenging (especially when you are just getting used to it), and the game just feels incredibly real, as a whole. Bottom line, it is a game that needs to be played in order to feel the full reach of all of its great elements. There are a few items in the game that can be nitpicked, but none of these are able to take away from this amazing experience in a significant way. It is certainly one of the best games of this gaming generation and is a great way to begin the closing out the PS3 era and bringing in the PS4 era. Unless you are into blowing up certain miniscule shortcomings into something that they are not and considering them abject failures worthy of a 0 or 1 rating on the game's part (which many user reviewers rating this game negatively seem to be doing here), you will certainly enjoy this game.

T3nh,"9.5/10. This game is amazing, but like all games, it's not without it's little hiccups. But for every problem, there are an infinite amount of fantastic things about this game.  Some might find the story predictable, but it's very well written, with many moments that will have you investing in these complex characters, Joel and Ellie, which provide some of the best acting I have seen in video games.  The combat can be trying at times but mostly fulfilling and engaging, as it's covered with lots of small details that add to the atmosphere of the game,  such as scripted events to keep you on your toes, conversations that add to characters or mood, and a crafting system that will have you thinking about what to save for the next encounter.  There will be some moments when the game slips up, such as your AI companions running in front of the bandits you are trying to hide from, and they don't bat an eyelid, or you are too busying scavenging for the necessary items that you miss the interesting conversations that pop up in the game, but these small things are easily forgiveable for what the game offers as a whole experience. The visuals are stunning, with some environments that will take your breath away, and detailed characters whose eyes convey what is unsaid. This game might not be for everyone, especially those who aren't interested in the stories games have to offer or are looking for something that will completely redesign their previous experiences. But for those looking for a game that has that solid and special blend of gameplay and story, this is it.   It's tense, evocative and beautiful.

Something that I think needs to be said here is that anyone who gets on here and says they truly ""played"" and finished this game in less than 10hrs is a liar. You may have finished the game but didn't truly play it...you didn't get immersed in it. It means that you run & gunned through it like an FPS...you didn't scavenge...you didn't fully investigate maps...you didn't invest in player skill upgrades because you couldn't have spent enough time to do it.  Please don't listen to those reviews. That said, the game is not flawless. There is the occasional AI companion glitch that will irritate you...especially if you are invested in the stealth aspect of the game, but man is it a great effort. The graphics are gorgeous. Everything feels very lush. The use of lighting in this game is spectacular. Especially interior lighting and time change lighting. The lighting and detail in the water scenes are phenomenal. The story is absolutely gritty and dark, and IT IS the flawless part. The best and worst of humanity.  Some of the best work I've ever played. Joel, Ellie, and even the secondary characters are very well fleshed out ...and done so in a very short amount of time in the storyline. The game is partitioned in a way that feels like large chapters of a book, but the game plays like a movie. It has that cinematic feel. It has a great beginning...a long, well-paced middle, and a crescendo-building ending. The games ability to literally force you to decide...do I make a health pack?..or do I make a molotov?...and which will help me best survive is unparalleled.  To me, this game feels like it pulled some of the best pieces of some of the best games in different genres. The feel of fear and horror are similar to Dead Space franchise and the BioShock franchise. The exploration piece feels similar to the Uncharted series and the new Tomb Raider. The upgrade mechanics are similar to Dead Space and Tomb Raider. I give these as references because I feel like those aspects of those games are some of the best out there on either console. I found myself wishing for the cover mechanics of the GOW franchise...especially when outnumbered, but you find other alternatives. Again, this game is not flawless...but man is it close. You can feel ND's love and effort in building this game. It is very close to a masterpiece.  When some games grow tiresome, The Last Of Us reminded me of why I love gaming. It force-feeds you great gaming. I would sit down to play for a while after my family went to bed...and look up 3hrs later, and be like...man I need to go to bed. I have almost 24 solid hours in this game. I gave it a 10 because it's better than a 9 on this scale. I would say 9.7 or better. Buy this game. Invest your time in it. Don't rush it. You will not be disappointed. This game sits among some legendary titles on a short lists that rises above ALL of the mass product put out there. It's brilliant.  VERY well done Naughty Dog!!",normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,0,0,9,test
Neonblu,A brilliant piece of gaming material with stunning graphics and deep emotional story and characters. I love the way how when I failed at trying a tactic to get through a level the game was able to give me other options at which I would succeed. I would name it one of the best games of my life. My only complaint would be that you could not chose between saving Ellie's life and curing the infection. But apart from this I must say this truly is a glorious 'must-have' for the PS3.,normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,0,0,9,train
RabidPuma,"The Last of Us is an exciting and emotionally moving adventure show what human interaction could be like after a apocalypse. Naughty Dog has created a gem that while not without faults is still one of the most important games ever released for the PlayStation 3.,,You play as Joel who through the course of the game is escorting his companion Ellie to a certain destination. During the journey the relationship that grows between Joel and Ellie is both touching and haunting to behold. Without spoiling the story, parts of Joel's past affect the way he currently views life and this provides a window into seeing how humanity might react following years after a great tragedy or apocalypse. Bitterness abounds in Joel's life early on, and yet by the conclusion of the of the tale the player is so wrapped up within the story that they will share a great deal of care for Ellie in almost a fatherly role. Parts of these emotions might be strong enough to bring tears to your eyes. It happened to me.,,Graphics: The game succeeds in pushing the PS3 to new boundaries. It's obvious that this console generation is coming to a close, but Naughty Dog did a great job at showing the possible beauty and abandonment of a nation desolated by destruction. The animations are top notch and the character models (thank you Joel for having an amazing beard) are hype-realistic. I experienced a bit of pop in at times but nothing that caused major issues in my play-through.,,Gameplay: The Last of Us succeeds in making the player struggle to survive against the harsh virtual reality of a fallen world. You will face environmental challenges, mutated monsters, and bandits struggling to survive. Throughout the game you given a minimal supply of weaponry to just barely get you to the next encounter. More times than not you will try to rely on Joel's stealth and brute force to overcome situations. This is both brutal and desperate, making you feel like every move you make has weight. Gunplay feels similar to Uncharted but a bit less accurate further reminding you that Joel is a real human and not some super hero. Encounters with enemies can be tough, and you will die. The game doesn't penalize you for death and check points are frequent to the point where it almost relieves a bit of tension. Even though you will die, the game is fair. I completed my first play-through on hard and felt that it possibly made the experience more rewarding than if I had played on normal. This is up to personal choice in the end and either way you will have a great time.,,Sound: The Last of Us sounds great. Voice acting is well done and all the characters are believable during cut scenes and even during seemingly random dialog. Joel's voice  makes it clear that he has had one hell of a life and that years of fighting for survival have taken a toll on his emotional and physical being. Ellie on the other hand has grown up in this world and shows spunky if not almost disturbing arrogance in the face of danger. Musically the game is strong, but doesn't leave any long lasting themes like you might find in Uncharted or Bioshock Infinite. Most of the game will be spent in silence which very accurately represents the forsaken empty world. During cut scenes, or other important events the sudden inclusion of music brings more weight than could ever be realized with a constant soundtrack.,,Possible Negatives: The only main negative point I could bring up the sheer number of times Joel must go find a ladder, trashcan, etc to prop open a door or gain access to the next area. This mechanic should have been thrown out in early design. I don't mind it every now and then but it did bother me enough to break me from the experience. I experienced one bug involving this that made me reload the game at one point. It's a minor complaint, but still matters. Some have argued that the game is too linear and would prefer a more ""choose your own path/ending"" scenario. To argue with this I would just take time to remind everyone that this game isn't about the players story. This is about Joel, and Joel may not make the same decisions you would. This is not a flaw, but a reminder that Naughty Dog has crafted a brilliant story and seeks to guide you through to the end. Accept this and you will have a blast.,,In summary, Naughty Dog has crafted a a brilliant emotional tale that touches the players hearts and yet brings ample excitement and adventure. While the game is not perfect it is something that will remembered fondly in years to come. For these reasons I highly recommend experiencing The Last of Us.",normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,0,0,9,train
Ultimitsu,"This game suffers the same over-hype as Killzone 2  it is a very solid game but it is nowhere near a perfect 10.,,For the positive, I will not waste time repeat in detail of what had been said in every review. It is suffice to say the story, the direction, the music, the voice acting and motion capture are all as perfectas they come. I will focus on why this game is not perfect overall.,,The main problem with this game is the gaming side. There are several issues:,,1, the scavenger system of going through every corner and open every draw looking for stuff gets very tedious very fast. Games are suppose to be fun, realism has its place but not in every place. We do not complain about how Joel can miraculously heal bullet wounds completely in the middle of the battle with just some alcohol and bandage or that he and Ellie can run and fight for many hours without a drink, a meal or a bathroom break, surely we would not mind a little less realism when it comes spend hours going through rubbish and other people's bathroom and bedrooms.,,2, this game is capped at 30 FPS, which is bare minimum for an action game, but because its serious use of PS3's outdated graphics card, FPS often drops down to 25~ish. Also the game uses triple buffer to avoid screen tear, where there is always a frame or two in the buffer before they are displayed. The the end result is that during the shooting part of the game the lag is quite noticeable, especially if you are running a LCD HDTV (which typically have about 30-80ms input lag).,,3, most of the enemy encounters are too easy while the inventory is too small and the check point is too frequent. For a survival game, it lacks a real sense of planning and suspense. If the raw material inventory was larger and enemy encounters demanded more use of items while each check point was longer, the gameplay would have been more challenging and more interesting.,,4, enemies are too dumb yet have too much health. They cannot see you or hear you when you are very close and still moving, or just behind an object (on hard). Their responses upon detection your presence is also quite limited.  Naughty Dog's first attempt at stealth gameplay was Uncharted 2. It is unfortunate to see they still haven't mastered this aspect of game design. If you want to know how stealth should be done, see Metal Gear Solid 4. On the issue of too much health, take the hunting rifle for example, it is hard enough to get a good long shot (seen point 2) yet enemies almost always require multiple shots to take down (until the end of the game where you get power and armour piecing upgrade).,,5, Ellie for most part of the gameplay is redundant. You do not have any control over her actions and you do not have to worry about her safety. It is understandable that she is not going to be a bullet sponge or second shooter but there should have been more gameplay interaction. For example give her some commands such as ""stay there"" or ""throw a bottle on my go"" would have been fun.,,The second problem that I would like to mention is the graphics. While I appreciate Naughty Dog has pushed PS3's graphics power to its limit I have reservations over some of their choices how to use that power. In particular I feel there are too many environmental objects with too much detail, such as countless beds, draws, tables, desks, boxes, bathrooms, wardrobes. This design choice is directly related with the FPS and lag issue and the excessive scavenging element of the game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,9,4,8,train
zombox5000,"The game is fine, its okay. It is not an epic, revolutionary change as has been touted by so many. It plays like a more stealth-oriented Uncharted. There are no stakes, no risk of failure. The characters, story, gameplay and everything else fit neatly into cookie cutter molds. The game is good.,,The multiplayer, however, is the biggest terd bowl I've seen in a long time online. Mismatched teams, bad options (like buying armor, which only benefits teams that are already ahead), confusing and tedious maps that you don't have a chance to learn until you've suffered your 80th losing match against people who play it constantly... even though its your first hour.

zeredeth,"This is one of the games that will keep you wondering. Last of Us is one of those games that you can honestly think that it was a movie. The graphics were great especially since there are the next gen systems coming out. The gameplay is smooth and the AI is good when you are in a bind. The only things that I thought were bad; were the controls and the lack of supplies. The controls are a little hard to learn at first but when you get used to them, you can run through the game without having to remember what does what. The lack of supplies is not truly a bad thing because I think that the game creators wanted to have you feel what it is like to try and survive in a post-apocolyptic world. There are just some spots in the game where you really need all the supplies you can just to get past a couple of spots. All in all the Last of Us is a great gift from Naughty Dog.",normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,0,0,8,train
Rice303,"As a gamer who enjoys the idea of choice in games, I was expecting a much different storyline to most other zombie games and I came out disappointed, there is nothing extremely bad in terms of gameplay and story in this game, but there's nothing amazing either, it just results to too many genre cliches during the half, while the second half simply starts to drag the simple idea of transporting someone from point A to point B, in the end, graphics are quite good, gameplay is average though puzzle solving and platforming sections are nearly exactly the same every time in a different area which is frustrating, another criticism I have is the ending, it left me speechless, but in the wrong way, I couldn't tell weather the game was good or bad after reaching the ending, which just felt like I went in an entire circle and happened abruptly, it wasn't a bad or good ending it was more like a stalemate in gaming, in the end, if you're looking for perfect. the first half-hour will be impressive, but the rest of the game, simply became an exercise or predictability, sudden and annoying combat and a story that tries to invest you emotionally, but worked more at the beginning then it did in the actual ending, in the end, I am waiting for the day when games like Spec Ops, The Walking Dead and the new Tomb Raider are combined properly without any problems and choice that affects the story, not just the combat, In the end, an overrated game, but not a bad one, the story intrigued me at the time despite predictability but ended horribly",normal,ps3,2013-06-22,English,9,1,6,train

RRGreiner,"There is a lot to be said about narrative. When it comes to games it is often easy to forget story and substitute exciting set pieces and flashy graphics. It is easy to allow a player to roam freely around a huge world and do whatever they please in lieu of any true structure. It is easy to grant creative freedom and remove all vestiges of a coherent tale. But what are you left with?,,There has been some degree of debate as to whether or not video games are art. While most of the debate has been based in the visual representation of art, the narrative has been mentioned more than once. Games have become more mature as the industry has grown and, as a result, have become far more than child like distractions. They have become art.,In the same way that the visual beauty of a painting or photograph can grab the observer, so can the incredible beauty of a digital, interactive landscape. Just as one can become lost in the art of prose from the likes of Hemmingway, Shakesphere, King, or Clancy, so can one lose themselves in an interactive narrative. Just like the combination of the visual and the narrative can captivate the imagination with film, so can the interactive cinematic experience. Video games, in some cases, are art. Period.,,The Last of Us is art.,,Let me begin the review proper by saying that The Last of Us is NOT perfect. It has flaws and I will point them out, but go into this knowing that even with flaws it gets a perfect score. So I give the final score ahead of the review for this one, 10.,,Ok, now, onto the review.,,From the very start of The Last of Us we are thrust into a world that is completely believable. The attention to detail the developers placed on this title is obvious and appreciated. Things look, sound, and feel believable and immersion is achieved easily. Joel (our 'hero') is a man with a life. He is clearly a good and simple sort of guy and his life looks to be the same balance of great and terrible that makes real life what it is. Then it is torn away from him. Tragically, torn away.,,From then on the familiar is gone. The Joel we see next is a different man. Changed by the past XX years of living in what is left of society. Altered by his experiences in this horrid new world and yet still, there is a hint of the former Joel just under the surface. It is this version of Joel that we take control of, and really get to know.,,As Joel and Ellie make their way across America they run into all sorts of challenges. Some are of a physical nature, others moral. What really echoes, however, is the personal journey each takes, alone and together. The narrative is where it is at here, not the excellent gameplay, not the remarkable visuals, the story. But more on that later...,,The gameplay in The Last of Us is nothing new in gaming. A third person camera and dual stick movement set the basic controls in familiar territory. L1 aims, R1 fires when aiming or reloads when not aiming. L2 sprints and R2 switches shoulders when aiming and enters into a sort of listening mode when not aiming. X is contextual, square melee attacks, O enters and exits sneak and triangle is another contextual button. The D-pad is assigned to inventory and weapon selection.,,Movement and aiming are easy enough and combat feels as brutal and satisfying as one might expect from the trailers. The variety of weapons available is good and there seems to be something for every situation. The enemies are not as varied as in other games but they are perfectly suited for the the story. They also require some thought when engaging as death comes quick and easy in this world.,,The only real flaws I can point out come in the form of difficulty spikes. Right when ammunition is critically low you will find yourself in situations that require a lot of it. While this is not done intentionally, the game can become frustratingly difficult. Until you think it out. In EVERY situation where I became stuck I found my solution by rethinking the encounter. For example a room that you have to defend for a certain amount of time will seem terribly difficult and then suddenly you realize that you can set up in a spot and eliminate a good number of baddies from a safe distance and then use your big stuff on the few tough baddies. The game is full of moments like this which works both for and against it at times.,,Exploration of each environment of a joy thanks to some of the best visuals this generation of gaming has seen and some of them best level design as well. Each level feels less like a path (though they very much are) and more like a way through. The way in which you traverse these areas is also well planned and thought out and seeing how Ellie and Joel aid one another through the world is a, thankfully, fluid experience and rarely if ever seems gimmicky or intrusive.,,All the best gameplay and graphical splendor means little without a solid story, and as I have mentioned, The Last of Us delivers. The story is the entire focus of the game and is kept going by a few clever ways. First of all the gameplay does a wonderful job of serving the story for the most part, managing to stay in context to the story and avoid feeling like just a game most of the time. Secondly the game gives you the opportunity to engage in optional conversations that also help to drive the personal narrative further. Lastly the game seems to revel in it's own story. It really knows that it is telling the story of these people and the journey they undertake and maintains a focus on that story.,,It is not often that I feel emotional attachments to game characters. Regardless of how they may try most characters fail to feel real to me. They are perfectly good at serving their purpose, but that is all. Joel and Ellie are more. Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite impressed me with how well she did things on her own and Ellie is just as impressive and I really cared about what happened to her.,I felt the pain they endured and enjoyed the moments of levity they shared (want to hear a joke). I was afraid for them and elated for them. In short, I felt an emotional connection with them. It helped that they seemed like real people. In look action, motivation, emotion, even just the way they move. Very convincing.,,Listening to the way they speak to each other and what they say makes the relationship between Ellie and Joel one that is not only interesting, it is fascinating and there is a very real sense of history and possibility that exists below the surface. Ellie asks Joel questions about what the world was like before and he avoids them or answers them. Ellie says and does things in a very mature way most of the time, but still has moments of pure child-like wonder.,,All in all The Last of Us is a game that plays like an interactive story. There are a few gameplay elements I didnt mention, like an upgrade system for skills and weapons, and a crafting system, that are present but really I just wanted to focus on what makes this game a 10. Sure, everything has to work well but that is the point. It does. Everything works like a game should AND has a story that I would love to read as a novel or comic series, or see as a movie.

CarsonEdta,"Is the world worth saving? Or will we become a mirror of despair, absent of hope, trapped in hell, sucked into the wake. You have to understand the impact of what exactly this game is trying to do, Its not a zombie story (despite popular belief) because in fact the virus cordyceps doesn't kill its victims. Instead it grows around the brain, and in time completely alters the victims face and movement. These infected are alive. Its disturbing to think about, unsettling at times. But why is this so important? Why is this game getting so much phrase?,,Take a look at naughty dog for a second, Uncharted, Jak and Daxter, these guys just don't make mature games. So how did they pull off making one of the most mature games in history? Because for every action you take in The Last of Us you remember that your characters Joel and Ellie aren't your typical protagonists. They kill, they steal, they run, they hide, and despite what we think is so horrifying, they are used to this desolated world around them, in short, they aren't normal, they are a new brand of human. An evolution of what we will become if we allow our self's to fall to darkness. The moment you have down time Joel and Ellie instantly talk casually about life and what the world used to be like. This is not a game about killing and blood, and terror. Its about sacrifice, hope, destiny. This is not a typical survival horror game, this is a compelling third person journey that once you get sucked in, you wont want the experience to come to an end.,,Well Mike that's all great but I want to play a game not watch a movie. That is the stroke of genius here, apart form being one of the best written games Ive played this generation, and one pulls some of the best performances, the games gameplay is some of the best to date. Its brutal, unforgiving, impact full, the ending will say with you for days, you'll want to play a second or third time. You'll want more, you'll want to know why naughty dog waited so long to show off there true talent. This game is a marvel, but I didn't always thing that, I wasn't convinced until I had the controller in hand, And I suggest you do the same.,,I will warn though, this game isn't for the faintest of hearts. Its violence is the most disturbing aspect, and here its done exceptionally well because it truly has meaning. The 15 to 18 hour game will teach you a lot about life if you allow it, don't limit yourself, if you are a true gamer, who likes compelling experiences stop reading the this and buy the game.,,Graphics, believe it or not uncharted 2 (at one time a fantastic looking game) is now wildly outdated, thanks mostly to this games superb art style. You'll want to reach out and touch your tv at times, each interior tells an interesting story, at times the game is at its best when you can just stop and explore the world around you.,,Sound, some uncharted call backs with weapon draws, but ultimately the sounds have just further add to the suspense. Clickers and infected in general are horrify. The entire cast is phenomenal, and the soundtrack is unbelievable.,,Story, I can say without hesitation that the real root of the story and its end will require some real thought, the game doesn't go into full detail at times, most of the story is told with strong symbolism.. so naturally many will hate it. I look for mature adult experiences, immature teens, kids, and adults for that matter will be left clueless. This game requires brains, I know, crazy right?,,Gameplay, 10. Weapons range from bricks to nail bombs, from revolvers to shotguns and all between. Which ever you chose to us, you will immediately feel the impact of each hit, each cry of pain and each blood spray. Its a small selection that never seems limited considering how each encounter feels dramatically different.  You never quite know what will be around the next corner, you are constantly on edge and never unprepared, that is if you search each nook and cranny for various supply's, and you'll want too. This precision and attention to detail are unmatched. This flaws are easy to overlook, considering it is so much better than what has been passing as a new $60 release in recent years.,,Its flaws, I hate the idea of giving a game a 10. No game is perfect. The last of us suffers from A.I. problems here and there, and at launch I was hit will and autosave bug which made me lose my first two hours of progress. This bug has been fixed, but whats important to note, even after all that, the game was so beyond what I had imagined, it didn't even bother me. I hope every developer takes something away from this game. This is the true future of games, I have no doubt in my mind.,,If you liked these games, you'll love The Last of Us.,,Alan Wake 9/10,Uncharted (whole series) 8/10,Tomb Raider (New) 7/10,Red Dead Redemption 9/10",normal,ps3,2013-06-21,English,1,0,10,test
dluo,"One of the few games I played that went beyond the conventional norms of a video games. I played too many games when it's just cut scenes follow by a wave a npc to take down follow buy more cut scenes and repeat. Games where the shooting mechanic just becomes generic, where no real challenge presents itself other than waves and waves of npc to take down. The Last of Us breaks this mold by engrossing me in a epic story with acting (and yes I say acting because that's what if feels like when I watch these living breathing believable characters) worthy of an Oscar. The cut scenes grips me the moment the game begins; and I have to say the introduction engross me so much that for a few moments I truly felt I was in the world of the game. The time when you take control of the character to fend off npc felt real. And there we're many times that I felt a real sense of danger, whether if its from the fungal zombies or the non infected hunting you down. At the end of the day the Last of Us engrossed my in a story that I only thought a movies can do. It really set the bar high for other games and makes me wonder why aren't more games like the Last of Us and less like the generic shooters that lacks substance in the story and character development department that plague this industry?

ChaosBreakGamer,"1st of all i would like to say immediately that because this game is by naughty dog it is somewhat linear. But the game does an amazing job in rewarding you the player for exploring every corner of the levels by giving you a lot of materials and ammo which are very rear ingredients within the world of the last of us. The environments in the game are simply Breathtaking and story deep and intense. the story is engaging and it became the game that brought me closest to tears in the start. Combat was intense and fluid with many ways to apply your items in it, as for ammo it is rear so it is not a game where you can 'run and gun' it is a game with remarkable and challenging A.I and simple to use yet deep mechanics. the game applies stealth very well and allows you to craft items with realistic strength, use and durability. the length is decent about 15 hours long and there is an even harder mode called 'survival' unlocked once you finished 1 play through, and the game has good replay value duo to the many ways of finishing various levels and there are mechanics such as the 'listening' ability that allows you to see enemies through walls and the crafting mechanic which is pretty self explanatory. this game is a definite triple A budget and it shows. the game may not be the best game out there but if you own  PS3 you owe it to yourself to buy this game because it is an unmissable experience, it has everything somebody like me wants in a game, good and fluid combat in which different enemies require diverse tactics that make you think before engaging in combat, a meaningful story with a satisfying conclusion and beautiful environments. this game is the whole package.",normal,ps3,2013-06-21,English,0,0,10,test
Bloodskulls,"No matter what anyone says, The Last of Us is truly one of the best games that I have ever played.  Everything in the game is amazing, from the in game graphics, to the cutscenes, and the gameplay, everything feels right, and it makes the game that much better.  Usually I dont give games a 10/10, because there is always something that bothers me.  But The Last of Us is one of the games that surprised me the whole time.  There was nothing wrong with the game, and it shows.  Everything is polished, and I loved how often little things struck me.  When Joel and Ellie are just walking, and then they start having a conversation, it really made the game feel alive.  This game is one of the few games in my opinion that is completly deserving of all the 10/10's it got, and the hype for this amazing game was very right.

Frazzcards,"Naughty Dog has done it again! The Last of Us is a story untold before, gruesome, suspense filled, and never failing to leave the ""what if"" factor of this infectious world and leaving surprise after surprise around each corner. Ellie, voiced by Ashley Johnson, personifies how people adapt to survive and how this world shows the need to change and grow up quickly. Joel, voiced by Troy Baker, also serves as an image on the necessary and harsh changes that the human race uses to overcome their weaknesses. The Last of us is unmatched in every way and is already a pronounced frontrunner for Game of The Year. It took me on an emotional journey that was challenging engaging and left me honestly awestruck that a video game could be this good.

From here on, it can only get better as Naughty Dog sets the bar yet again for how a game should portray a story and mix it with deep and calibrated gameplay.  What games such as this can do is why gaming is a unique medium in entertainment. You cannot get an experience like this in a movie or a tv show. Top-notch acting, story, characters you care about and can relate to, polished settings as well as controls and gameplay that, contrary to naysayers, is not repetitive unless you make it so; as with any other game ever made. The few negatives are the usual, trivial problems that should not detract from a game such as this for anyone: AI going unnoticed clearly in view of enemies which can smite the illusion and extreme gore which isn't even a negative but definitely something not for everyone. However, gore can be turned off. Do not be turned off by people saying the game is overrated, it is not. There is a reason why critics and users alike love this game.

Uberwatch,"II am not a PS3 gamer so I do not know Naughty Dog and their games very well. Or PS3 exclusives as a matter of fact. But as a fan of post apocalyptic fiction in general and an avid PC Gamer, I was intrigued that a game called The Last of Us was coming out. So I played this game, start to finish on my friend's PS3 and was just blown away.,,The Last of Us is a linear game, but in a very good way. You don't seem to have much control of Joel as in making choices that affect the story-line but this is a cinema-like feature in a game. It's not just movie-like Unlike games like Heavy Rain where you have basic controls with the game environment but a captivating plot, The Last of Us gives you a wide variety of third-person shooter game mechanics. From crafting supplies and using your limited-weapons, the gameplay is focused. You either stealth out each level or go berserk. Your choice. and every so and then, a cut scene appears. But these cut-scenes are not your average cutscenes. Not only do they have great motion-capture on the faces, but the voice acting is just incredible. I do not know Naughty Dog very well, but they I can tell they had a huge budget to craft this masterpiece, and they used it well.,,The story-line however is sort of a misunderstanding to me. It starts out a bit cliche, having to bring the young girl Ellie to the fireflies (A resistance group trying to find a cure to the cordyceps virus)but when the story shows you these predictable plot points, it's just twist and turns, and that's when the writing is just clever. A moment in the game's story was making you think Joel, the main character was going to die, which I thought was predictable, until they revealed he was healing all along. Having said that, You'd think the storyline isn't all too great when it seems the game is a long courier mission across the country, but the the point of the story is, The Courier becomes attached to the package, emotionally. and that is where the plot thrives.,,The enemies in this game are well designed. I found the clickers and runners quite scary and their different behavior patterns made the overall gameplay challenging. The bandits, or hunters on the hand were much more terrifying. I found the living threat in this game very Walking Dead-esque and exciting. Even some of the bandit characters like David affect the main characters Joel and Ellie.,,Last and not least, the overall design on this game is just art. Each level had so much vivid detail, this wasn't lazy level design here. And the game was about 14 hours long, that's the real kicker on how much time was made to make this great game.,,I don't usually like how the video game medium tries to push itself as an art form, but now I can see why, and The Last of Us is one of these titles that will turn the industry into what motion pictures are right now today.",normal,ps3,2013-06-21,English,0,0,9,train

The thing that makes this game stand out from the crowd is the relationships between main and supporting characters. Ellie and Joel have great chemistry, I mean GREAT chemistry.

KyleThompo,"I will NOT spoil this wonderful game for you, as you need to experience it yourself!,,Right from the get go, THE LAST OF US has you fully intrigued into this beautiful wasteland in which NAUGHTY DOG have done one hell of a job imagining! The way in which it opens is better than most narratives, the way it makes you feel is unlike anything I have ever felt towards a video game (or most movies for that matter) in my life. One reason THE LAST OF US' narrative is unmatched by most games, is because it has a cast of brilliant actors who are extremely believable and the fantastically modeled characters that are animated perfectly that they voice.,,(This paragraph, may contain a MINOR SPOILER, skip ahead if you don't want to risk figuring out the plot from what I state here),There is a really strong message incorporated into THE LAST OF US. That message being, in a situation such as the post-apocalypse which is filled with crazed, infected humans that want to bite and kill you. The infected aren't the ones to fear, it is the humans! The way in which that is got across is amazingly written and a very difficult choice made easy is made because of it!,,Okay, there were a few problems on the gameplay front that will take you away from the immersion such as; the AI (from what I saw previous to its release, I thought the AI was going to be unlike any other, realistic in every way) but it does come with its buginess that sadly kind of takes away from the realistic vibe NAUGHTY DOG seemed to be going for. For example, the enemy NEVER seemed to notice Ellie, or the other allies that tagged along with Joel when they were in clear sight of them (e.g. Ellie would walk right into an enemy and would move by without been spotted) & enemies wouldn't be alerted by a body on the ground. But these problems will not make me subtract any points from what I believe is possibly the greatest game I have ever played! And besides, the bugs  glitches have been made up for with some of the best and most brutal killing animations in the history of gaming (each kill seems unique from the last one) you will find yourself cringing at what you will make Joel do to these poor (but evil as hell, so its okay) survivors.,,So why do I consider it ""the greatest game I have ever played"". Well, I like a good story, a story that makes you feel, a story you can not stop following & a story that is simply, told well. THE LAST OF US does all of that PERFECTLY! I have never played a game with so much heart, so much character, so much, AWESOMENESS... the story in THE LAST OF US is so damn powerful and puts all of whom say games are not capable of telling stories that are worth while to shame!,,One last thing, about the genre in which THE LAST OF US is categorized into (post-apocalyptic  zombie apocalypse) it has done it better than any other narrative in that genre for me! It was perfect and it ended (NO spoiler) differently to expected. And I will be remembering that prologue especially, for years to come (as it is one of the best I have seen in fiction). NOW THAT IS ONE WAY TO OPEN A STORY!,,NAUGHTY DOG have done it again folks (they are officially one of the most trustworthy developers that never seem to disappoint!),,---,,PLUSES,,+ The campaign lasts longer than most linear-based games on the market nowadays (at a finishing time of 14  16 hours when going through it how expected),,+ It actually gives you a bit of a challenge when you play it on the higher difficulties (I hear easy is tricky too, didn't play on it),,+ There are some surprises around every corner,,+ OH, HOW THE HELL DID I ALMOST FORGET.

Genres trundle along, evolving, merging, supplying us masses with many a great game.,,The Last of Us doesn't give us any real new game mechanics, everything here has been done before, in various ways, and with varying success. What it does, it does very well. The elements of stealth, gunplay, exploration all feel very solid. It is graphically outstanding, and provides many a 'wow look at that' moment.,,What sets this game apart, is somewhat hard to explain. Never has a game made me feel emotional to the extent that The Last of Us has. This really is a game to savour, to take your time with, to explore. The characters feel like strangers to begin with, as they should, but as you play, slowly, you get to know them. It's a cliché, but the journey is important. It's not a game about ploughing through and stomping heads, but about people, in a situation.,,I have never played a game before where I have been so eager to see that next cut scene, or to trigger that next snippet of dialogue, and I find myself hanging on every word, and every expression.

After feeling a little underwhelmed with the previous uncharted game, I was beginning to suspect a possible decline in Naughty Dogs ability to create truly fantastic games after making them for so long. Even the great kings must fall, but alas not today.,,The Last of Us is an absolute marvel and truly a wonderful, yet dreary experience. The combat feels like a fight for survival, whenever you startle an infected or alert a guard, panic sets in and you realize that you have less than enough resources to finish the job. The overall sense of dread throughout might seem as though it would cause some serious burnout late in the game, but Naughty dog manages to keep it interesting all the way through.,The story is wonderful, though I won't say anything about it to avoid spoiling anything, but it never misses a beat.,The graphics are possible the greatest on any console at the moment (excluding PC) and the art direction really helps with worn down cities taken over by vegetation.,unfortunately there are some AI issues in the game, but these are generally few and far between.,',The surprise of the whole package though is the multi-player, seamlessly integrating all of the tactics and resource management that has been learnt in the single player game.

While the game is violent, it's never gratuitous out of the blue, the violence makes sense in the world Naughty Dog created.,,The gameplay practically requires treading carefully through levels.  This is something I love in games.  This, coupled with limited ammo/health while throwing in a slew of infected enemies, provides a genuinely nerve racking experience.  If you got shot, you feel Joel's pain.  When you have 3 bullets and numerous enemies surrounding your position, you have to out-think/out-maneuver the enemies by using the environment to your advantage.,,The graphics are superb.  It's the best looking game on PS3 no question about it.  The Sound is amazing as well, from the music to the enemies, everything is top notch.  One of the infected, aptly known as ""Clickers"" use echolocation to hunt humans.  While they are blind, their keen sense of sound allows them to track your location with the slightest movement.  When this happens, they make a terrifying clicking sound to alert other infected nearby.  It is genuinely terrifying when this happens.,,All in all, it is a terrific game that I would recommend to most people. With that said, this game isn't for everyone.  For one, if you like action adventure games where you are supplied with countless weapons, armor and ammo, The Last of Us isn't for you.  If you are offended by mature violence, themes and language, The Last of Us isn't for.  If however, you can handle the mature themes, this game is a MUST PLAY.

I guess the easiest way to quickly describe how the game plays is to compare it to a different title. In this case it feels a lot like Tomb Raider with a few differences, such as stealth being a huge part despite having absolutely no silenced weapons the platforming being a little lacking and blatant usage of one hit killing enemies, which I also think is justified.,,In any case, yes, the game has a ton of problems, yes, it can be frustrating as hell and slightly boring at times... However, all of these issues, despite sometimes being very major ones, become absolutely meaningless when you take into account all of the brilliance coming from voice acting, character design and the story, which I want to get deeper into without spoilers.,,The story... ah, the story. I honestly didn't feel like this game had any story at all, no concrete plot to speak of. It really felt more like... just life. A story is always designed to be something, there is always a plan and no matter how good a writer is, it's impossible to completely conceal the future from the audience because stories are predictable. They aren't real, you can figure out what will happen or assume more or less what the outcome will be. The Last of Us however, absolutely dominated this issue.,,It drew me in so deep into its world that for the first time in months if not years, I paid completely no attention to storywriting whatsoever. I wasn't questioning why the writer has made this decision or the other or what may or may not come out of all of the events that took place along the way. All of the time it felt natural. Nothing drove the story forward, it just kept going on its own because... well, what else was it really supposed to do? It felt as real as it gets.,,The brilliant voice acting and character creation was incredibly helpful in that respect as well. This is also one of the few times where I felt the crispness of characters. They felt natural. They felt real. It isn't even about the ability to relate to them or them being likable or not. A character doesn't have to be likable to be well designed. I cannot say I specifically liked anybody in The Last of Us. But despite that I got attached to them because their emotion and their story felt so convincing and real. The feelings I had went much deeper then they usually go when I invest myself in video games. Much deeper than they went in The Walking Dead  a game which so far was my absolute top and example of how to attach a player to the characters. Here it was different. Here the game has managed to defeat my mind. I no longer reasoned with myself whether or not do something or not or why I am doing it. I did it because I felt I had to. I did it because my heart told me it's how it should be. And afterwards after I logically thought about it I saw how my mind was screaming that nothing about this makes sense and cannot be justified but even then I didn't care and if face with the choice again I would not be able to change my decision.,,For this, despite the game deserving a 6.5 out of 10, it gets an entire 10. Not because it was exceptional or perfect in doing something, but because it had a charm. A charm I have found in a number of games lower than the number of fingers in my palms.

A survival-horror video game with so much complexity among the characters, the story line, the powerful emotions, the intense game play for survival, and the amazing graphics for I could say that I want to play it more often at least on how the game was meant to end up being. It's one of the best games of the PlayStation generation; therefore making it another masterpiece created by Naughty Dog. Mainly, I focused on the tense feelings of the two main characters in which how they were able to survive their journey across the post-apocalyptic United States from beginning to end, showing steps through affection they have between each other.

sityoazzdown,"This game was a masterpiece. The gameplay was fun, and the limited ammo made you adjust the way you play the game. The stealth was a good option to have, and is very effective. The character's and the story was the star of the game, all the character's had emotions that you can relate with; it felt like a real post apocalyptic world. My only complaints in this game were that the A.I was overrated, and I would've prefered more infected enemies than human enemies. But yeah if your expecting a dead rising type game, you would be disappointed, I would even go as far as say this game is slow paced in a good way; but it was worth it at the end. It was like a rollercoaster of action, emotion, suspense, fear, drama, etc. I actually didn't want this game to end, and not a lot of games can do that with me.",normal,ps3,2013-06-20,English,2,0,10,train
thenthomwaslike,Naughty dog has outdone themselves again. The story draws you in to loving characters based on how human their flaws are and has a distinct Cohen brothers style of ending that makes you think about the characters and how nuanced they are. All of this is built on top of a sturdy foundation of stealth gameplay and a great leveling system. It's broken into 4 chapters that all have the emotional impact to stand on their own.,normal,ps3,2013-06-20,English,2,0,10,train
Strike2,"If the Last of Us has shown us anything it's that a linear 3rd person action-stealth game with no truly original gameplay mechanics can deliver one of the finest, most intense gaming experiences ever created. The gameplay is not revolutionary, 3rd person stealth mixed up a bit with a see through walls mechanic is definitely not new but there is a huge level of polish with the system. This is one of my favourite cover systems in a game, you crouch and in true video game fashion all walls are a convenient height for you to hide behind but transitioning in and out of cover is seemleess because there is not transition. you are not locked to cover and are free to move anywhere. Another thing that shines is how real bullets feel, when shot you will not only flinch, you will fall backward like you are actually hurt and there is no regenerating health and health kits are not instant either, you take time to apply them which when not considered can be fatal. Crafting is awesome because you are never pulled out of the game. Story and atmosphere are what trulky bring the game together though. This is not a happy story about saving the world from the apocalypse, its a personal journey about the relationship between Joel and Ellie and how they care for each other, the emotion between them and how they're companionship grows. Ellie is a great companion to have not just because of her usefulness in tricky spots, but because she is so human. She asks questions about what life was like before and watching her change throughout the story is brilliant. The journey with these 2 characters takes place in a world with some of the best graphics in gaming history with such intricate attention to detail. Everything in the worls is placed there for a reason with notes scattered that you take the time to read because they look human. This helps create one of the best and most immersive atmosphere's in a game. Lets not forget of course about the infected, the whole reason the world is like this at all. The game is mostly balanced between fighting human and infected but you fight humans a little more often so its surprising that most of your deaths will come from the infected. Hearing the sound of the clickers, infected that are blind but have sensitive hearing creates for some very tense gameplay as you try to sneak past. This game is riddled with these tense moments. It is taking some highly polished gameplay and wrapping it in a beautiful immersive world that revolves around Joel and Ellie. Most people that say the game is boring have only played the first couple of hours and if they have finished it they just don't understand what the game is doing. You must play this game alone, with no distractions like chatrooms and play in long sittings and just let the game fill you up.

Also, if you're going into to this game you should know that you're entering into a game where there's barely any happy moments and violence around every corner.,,There's quite a few people who play this game and obviously don't get it. The Last of Us is a very character drive action-adventure, survival game. The gameplay is constantly an intense experience where you never really know what to expect. You could probably nitpick the crap out of the game because it's not perfect, no game is. My personal experience with the game was a special experience that no game has really delivered yet. The level of attachment you feel for these characters is just incredible. The Ai are smart, your resources within gameplay is sparse forcing you to make strategic decisions, and the story is fantastic.,,I'm not a huge multiplayer person so it was a huge shock when I got to the multiplayer and found out I really enjoy it! The multiplayey captures that intensity and gameplay experience the single player had. It is really fun.,,This game is the best game to do date (in my opinion) on the PlayStation 3. There's been a lot of great games over the years but I feel this is the perfect swan song for the PS3. By the end of if it you really feel for these characters, and it's one hell of a ride.

hamdihamzeh,"i just got the last of us few days ago. trust me. it is amazing! the stories completely immerses you feeling like what it would be like when you are actually in a post apocalypse never let down i would be willing to play this game again unlike bioshock infinite i felt like i was talking to real people.,,gameplay wise it really made me jump whenever i would go into a room with a clicker i would get scared to death trying not to get caught and looting a whole room making sure i have all bullets which is a key element to a post apocalyptic game i hardly used my gun only for runners trying to kill me. the graphics are amazing whenever i go take a walk in a shop i would notice all the detail and how naughty dog took so much effort into making this. if you are not a gamer or not a one who enjoys survival horror this is not the game for you i seen critics giving the game a 8/10 which is completely stupid.,,the story is so good having a team and ending up with just a partner pulls you into the sorrow and devastation into what happened to these people or what will. crafting is really important element in this game, i never used building both healing kit and shivs to stealth kill a clicker. i truly love this game having guilt whenever i would pass a conversation or a cut scene with joel and ellie. these characters have such a way of bonding it us unlike any other game i have experienced. ever. ellie was bought into this cruel world where joel has not having different view points about the world around them. very sad which is really good. this game is better than uncharted. im serious i hate playing this game because whenever i do i have less time to get to the end. i wish i could just wipe out my memory and play it again. i think ellie is my favorite game partner ever. despite ellie being invisible why would you want to get caught if she was visible. i would just be walking and she would start whistling or swear at something. throw a brick at an enemy A.I. and i would kill them instantly. i did not use most of my weapons in my storage i mostly used the shotgun for clickers whenever i did not have a shiv to stab a clicker in the neck. this game is so amazing i wonder what time it took naught dog to make it because i just loved playing the game and i hope there is some story DLC coming because i just love watching the bond between joel and ellie and how they change whenever they work together. if you have not played the game i am going to say a spoiler. joel and ellie find two survivors called henry and sam. as you progress you go to their hide out at their last cut scene. sam is very upset and asks ellie about her fears when they finish and ellie goes to bed sam shows a bite on his leg. the following day ellie wakes up to get sam for breakfast and is attacked. henry shoots sam and tells joel it his fault. while joel tries to take the gun henry commits suicide and shoots himself in the head. that is a 10/10 game showing how cruel the world they live in is and how people go insane and dont know how to react. i just love playing the game no joke it is the best game i have ever played. ever. some people might not understand but you have to understand the game genre and how people react to these types of situations that is due to low scores. this is how you leave a mark on a console the playstation 3 with the upcoming playstation 4 this game is a mark of great games a masterpiece.,,i have to talk about ellie she is the best characters i have encountered in a game and how she is just used to killing infected people is just amazing i remember playing sleeping dogs and a 20 year old guy shot a man in the head and got depressed about it. some characters cant live with themselves when they kill. but thats it ellie kills for her partner joel and helps him showing their bond of not having any guilt whatsoever and just doing it for a helping hand and not reconsidering and going into devastation like other characters. ''it was either him or me'' thats what joel told ellie when joel was nearly gonna die from a murderer. knowing to keep an eye out for each other and not caring. thats why ellie is such a good character knowing their a team and always will be a team. basically ellie is the main character even on the main hardcover on the game,,the characters are what make this game so believable and real and so in depth that you can actually feel the emotion of a character and what there going through and being so interested in what there doing so simple as enjoying a view makes it a masterpiece,,the textures on the characters look like actual people. i started wishing that joel and ellie where real people because i have never seen such personality and bond is so refreshing and enjoyable. the years and effort put into this game pays off as one of the best video games ever made.,,time to wrap this up. this game is amazing truly a wonderful experience i will never forget i know that this game will be the game of the year masterpiece",normal,ps3,2013-06-20,English,1,0,10,train

Jones21,"I have to say, this is definitely one of the best game I have ever played in my life. And when the reviews said this game takes 16 hours to finish, they weren't kidding.,,Let's pick the obvious positives that this game nails: graphic, atmosphere, voice acting, music and gameplay. The graphic is like Uncharted 3, but with more realistic gore and with a post apocalyptic environment that's like Enslaved with greens all around. The character's facial expressions itself looks almost photo realistic with great voice acting from each characters. It's easily the best graphic I have ever seen in any game period. The music fits the various situations of the game, ranging from beautiful soft somber music to upbeat when going into battle.,,The gameplay itself is also excellent. It uses a modified Uncharted engine which makes hand to hand combat feels brutal and satisfying to pull off. Each enemy takes 7 punches to kill, but you can grab a weapon like a baseball bat to increase the melee damage that takes enemies out in 3 hits, or even better a bladed weapons that kills them with 1 hit, though weapons can break depending on their durability. Shooting weapons in the game feels powerful and awesome, but the game is very2 strict on ammo though. The max ammo that you can store for the handgun for example is only 21 bullets, revolver is only 18 while the rifle is only 7. You can upgrade the maximum ammo capacity but it'll only give you 1 bullet extra that you can store per upgrade, so every bullet counts. You can also build various tools such as a shiv or a small dagger and a Molotov  to roast enemies into dust that can be crafted by having the right ingredients. If you want to see the game in action, look no further than the E3 2012 demo. You can do everything in the demo in this game, and as you can see from that demo, the enemy ai is smart and will react realistically.,,People say this game is an action adventure survival horror game, but I personally believe it's more like Splinter Cell Conviction only without the ability to do mark and execute and without the ability to climb like a monkey, and a lot more gore. This game is very heavy on stealth as every encounter with an enemy always involves hiding from them and outsmarting them to take them all out. If you go out in the open like usual third person shooter games nowadays, you will die quick. So I suggest doing stealth kills really often by getting behind an enemy, press triangle and press square to immediately knock them out unconscious. Or if you are gunned down, either go behind an enemy or beat the crap out of an enemy up front until you can press triangle button to use them as a human shield. This is one of the save way to shoot at an enemy without getting killed, so I recommend this strategy often as it save ammo and it feels badass.,,The upgrade system in this game comprises of 2 categories: weapon upgrades and skill upgrades. For the weapon upgrades you have to collect gears to get enough points to upgrade a weapon, and occasionally you will have to collect a toolbox to allow further weapon upgrades. Skill upgrades on the other hand requires you to collect vitamin pills....... yeah you heard that right, you have to collect vitamin pills to upgrade your skill. Pretty funny. I recommend stacking up 75 pills to get the useful skill of counter attacking the ""clicker"" mushroom head enemies and not buy the other skills before you got that. These mushroom heads are a pain in the ass to kill. You have to collect daggers, or shiv, to stealth kill them or else you will have to beat them up JUST in time before they grab you or shoot them from afar. If they grab you and you don't have that skill I mentioned or you don't have any dagger, you're instantly dead.,,The game's multiplayer is pretty interesting and very well done. Unlike the usual multiplayer games with modes like capture the flag, free for all and team deathmatch, this game only have 2: raid and survivors. Raid is team deathmatch only with 20 allowable respawns per team, while survivors is like Counter Strike. At the main menu, you can choose between 2 factions: Fireflies (good guys) and the Hunters (bad guys). After you select your faction, you are given this interesting micro management minigame where you have to handle survivors staying in your camp. So basically, you have to kill enemies in multiplayer and collect blue pills as required by the survivors in your camp. If you perform well, the number of survivors will grow and the more they are the more items you unlock. But if you don't perform well in multiplayer, the survivors can get sick and get hungry which will decrease their numbers.It plays exactly like the singleplayer and it makes for some intense hide and seek battle.,,Overall, a must buy for every PS3 owners out there.

The story, the characters, environment, the music, and the complete immersion this game offers is utterly amazing. The Last of Us already set the bar high and the benchmark for the next generation of consoles; however, I am sure that Naughty Dog is up to the task with a bigger and better product that we can all enjoy. While I do agree with the 10/10's that critics have given this game and it is rightfully earned by Naughty Dog, however, I gave it a 9 to be completely fair as this game is technically and emotionally brilliant but every game has it's issues. Ellie and other supporting NPC's that follow Joel in his journey are basically ghosts when it comes to the stealth portion of the game, which breaks the immersion. This is a little thing, but I also noticed that in multiplayer, the hit markers are not accurate as I shot through other plays countless of times. With these little issues it broke my heart to give it a 9 or even a 9.5 because I really wanted this to be a 10.

The post apocalyptic world/zombie theme has been done over and over again, but the characters and their struggles in this game more than make up for it. The gameplay is very much Uncharted, but less action heavy and more stealthy, as you really have to have a good strategy to take down enemies in this game. The Last of Us is kind of a miss mash of open world, third person action, stealth, and shooter all in one. This game is definitely not a mindless shooter though, you need to strategize and actually think about how to proceed with certain situations in the game.

I waited for this game for a frigging long time, almost 2 years, and the only reason i bought playstation 3 was this game. in my opinion this game could have been the best game ever, if you'd were given the choice of option during the game. An ending compiled of the choices you make is the future of gaming, you're supposed to tailor the game to please everyone, when being a massive  maker in the gaming industry. And also you have to have the time to do that. I understand that sony is putting a lot of pressure on the naughty dog, and there are deadlines to be held, but even so, i kinda wished for a branching storyline.,,I played the game with the normal difficulty, and still felt it was a little bit too easy, since i didn't have a single time that i would've ran out of bullets. I loved the converstations between the characters, and how their personality changed during the gameplay and they became closer. Also loved the game intro and shed my first tear after the first 15 minutes of gameplay. The atmosphere in the game is really rich and beautiful, aesthetics work from beginning to end. (and personally for me the graphics do too) The only problem with the game was probably the tubular structure of levels, the design is great from any other part.

Olenius,"Oh boy, where do I get started with such a game? I'm going to be completely honest I really don't understand the hype that was created with this game. It's basically like they took Uncharted, took the worst part from the game (the really useless stealth mechanics), and then made a whole game from it. Why is this game so hyped? I want to say that the hype was created for ONE SOLE REASON, zombies... but that's not really true (see War Z  for proof that zombies aren't that a guaranteed success). The real reason Is the fact that they are Naughty Dog and they can do whatever the hell they want and sell and game. No on to the topic of the actual game. First off, the characters, which some people I'm sure find ""deep"" are actually extremely cliché, stereotypical and basically reprinted versions of characters from about a million other films/games. Seriously the characters' ""bonds"" between are about as deep as a dried up puddle. Second of all, the game itself is really lacking in the actual mechanical department. All you do is walk around slowly and be an edgy goober with your little prick girl sidekick who can't stop swearing. I mean seriously? Is it that fun to strangle a million zombies? If you think so then good for you, but honestly I got tired of seeing that animation after about the 300th time. Third and finally, the games graphics look they came out of the rear of a donkey, relatively of course, it's nice for a console, but seriously? Have you guys ever played a pc game fully maxed out? It's nothing like the BEST GRAPHICS IN WORLD HURR DURRR stuff I have been hearing, it's honestly pretty mediocre and just over filtered (to make the world seem EDGY).

When I do play a game though, I take it seriously, and want something that hooks me with a good balance of challenge and reward, and great gameplay.  Well with the hype this game had behind it and the scores how could I have been ripped off by another game like bioshock infinite (which blatantly dumbed down and removed gameplay)? Welp I was, and I've officially lost complete faith in gaming. This game is living proof that gaming is dead. It's been more than 8 years since the release of resident evil 4, yet this game doesn't even attempt to outdo gameplay standards set in the survival genre this game is (laughably) trying to claim it belongs to. In fact, it's gameplay should be completely unacceptable in the year 2013, but the unwashed masses who bought into the console craze ""because of duh grafix!"" will throw their hands in the air and claim this and every other overhyped game like it is ""duh best game evarrr!!!"". I'm sorry but if you only play games for the graphics, blood, and story, and you don't value gameplay you are not a gamer, and I am now convinced the mainstream console audience and the audience these games are aimed at are not gamers. This game is nothing different than the same old handholdy LCD shooter we've been seeing all generation long, cover based shooting, simplistic gameplay leading you from cutscene to cutscene, checkpoints every few steps, dull brown and grey graphics, ect. The only reason this game is getting so much praise is because of the hype behind it, people are like sheep and go right along with the hype, afraid to say anything that conflicts with common opinion. If the game wasn't made by naughty dog and had no hype behind it, it wouldn't be getting anywhere near the praise. Want proof? Look at all the good reviews, all they say is ""best game evarrrrr"", they won't give reasons though, and if they do they're related to graphics or some other element irrelevant to the game itself or how it plays. The game is also awfully glitchy considering it's made by ""The best developer of this generation"", what a  joke, can't even get the save system right, me and my friend had to play it all in 1 sitting, not like it matters because games today are so short and simple. I seriously wonder how long it will be until they phase gameplay out all together and just go back to making FMV games, or QTE driven games, because mark my word, that's the direction these amateur developers who run the industry are setting gaming up to be headed in.

It is a great story, with amazing, believable characters, incredible voice acting and music score, top notch sound effects and atmosphere, great and brutal gameplay where every kill counts, in most video games you pass across waves of enemies but killing doesn't matter, in this game every kill counts, it's close and personal, it's necessary.

holdfasthope87,"From someone who has been a hardcore gamer for 20 years, and who is also a HUGE film buff: This is, for me, the best game I have ever played. Why? First, the story is MASTERFUL. If this was a movie, I really believe it would have blown the critics away, and would have most likely gone down as an enduring classic. Incredible atmosphere of tension (definitely reminded me of a Coen brothers film), heartbreaking emotion (and I am almost never moved by video games stories), great ""cinematography"", and a script that in my opinion surpasses Cormac McCarthy's novels. Naughty Dog has drawn from a wealth of influences, and has created a story that is better than them all (in my opinion).,Second, the gameplay is TENSE and very fun. If you didn't feel tension while playing this game, then you need to switch to hard difficulty (and listening mode turned off), because normal mode is for average gamers. I started on the hardest difficulty possible, with no listening mode, and man was this game incredibly tense. (I felt more tension throughout this than No Country For Old Men...I actually had to take breaks to give my stomach a rest). While the combat is not perfect (no game is), its VERY good, and not worth nitpicking due to how it services the phenomenal story.,Third, this is the most immersive experience I think I have ever had, in gaming or in film. While there are occasional bugs due to the ambitious nature of the game, they are quite rare, and in the course of my 20 hour playthrough,  I took my time stealthily in order to conserve the limited ammo I had, and explored the world thoroughly), I actually experienced tension, fear, disgust, hatred, hope, love, joy, peace, brokenness, sorrow. There are moments in this game that I will never forget.,Lastly, the game is deeply philosophical. What at first glance appears to be a cliched ""zombie"" (although the infected are nothing like zombies, and are much more believable in my opinion) story is slowly revealed to actually be a fascinating study on humanity, morality, and love. This becomes apparent after the conclusion of the game. The game is so profound and well constructed that I could analyze its meaning (through mise en scene and use of motifs) in the same way I would a movie like ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" ""The Godfather,"" or ""Pans Labyrinth."",To sum it up, this game in a masterpiece. I honestly believe (in my opinion) that those who didn't like the game are either: 1) shallow gamers who enjoy mindlessly repetitive ""Call of Duty"" games rather than meaningful stories, 2) bad gamers, who thought that the gameplay was ""broken"" due to their lack of skill, and 3) People who don't understand how to interpret and understand masterful works of literature and film. IMO this game's meaning went over some people's heads. If you appreciate powerful films from geniuses like Martin Scorcese, Stanley Kubrick, Guillermo del Toro, and especially the Coen Brothers, you will love the artistry of this game.,This game dethroned the masterpiece The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time from the top spot in my favorite games of all time. IT'S THAT GOOD. Gameplay wise, I think Zelda is a bit better, but the story of The Last of Us is one of my favorite stories ever (whether game, film, or book). No other game comes close. Gameplay is created to serve the story, so if you are into games only for the sake of mindless Call of Duty action rather than deep story and intelligent strategic combat, or if you are a fan of Micheal Bay style movies, don't play this game, its art will be wasted on you. To those with (in my opinion) good taste, GET THIS GAME!!!",normal,ps3,2013-06-19,English,5,4,10,test
Toffenuff,"Great story. Amazing graphics/effects add to the sensational immersion. Fantastic characters who you (at least I did) actually feel for and become invested in, particularly since there really is character development. Voice acting is superb. The opening scene, with what happens to Joel and... well, wow. That hit me hard and was totally unexpected. I may or may not have teared up, and that was within ten minutes after starting the game. Lots of great heart-pumping action and unexpected twists of varying sizes that help to really spice things up, because just when you think it's going one way it goes another.,,My cons/gripes: shooting in this game could use some improvement. Gameplay is still rough around the edges too.. And the AI in terms of enemies and your allies, while often great, is sometimes erratic and unrealistic in that sometimes while sneaking around my ally would be all up in the enemy's face and neither one would do anything  as if they didn't see each other even though they were right in front of one another.,,All in all, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME.",normal,ps3,2013-06-19,English,5,4,10,test

penemue,"This game is truly fantastic. It deserves every bit of praise that it gets  but unlike other reviews I'm going to try and simply break down why. Firstly it's an action game, so it's a 1010 action game, not the greatest game of all time, out of every genre. So what's important in an action game? Action right? The gunning feels more realistic than any other TPS I've experienced so far, and every weapon is so unique to handle it actually feels like you're carrying a real assortment. What about AI? Humans will come up behind you in a matter of seconds to shoot you from behind, if they can't get behind you, they will throw a molotov  at you with pensive precision. What about stealth? Clickers must be dealt with by crouching and not walking  but creeping, if they hear a loud footstep they will come charging, and on contact you will die instantly. Not only is the challenge there but it feels so nerve-racking no matter where you go. Humans can also be dealt with stealthily, choking them to do, wasting no resources, or if you choose, move past everything, like something out of MGS.  Combat  it's there as well, numerous objects can be used as melee weapons, a bat will take a few hits down someone with a combo, whereas a blade might take just one to kill. You can even reinforce weapons with blades to cause one hit kills on Clickers. hear you asking about the rest... Graphics? It's Naughty Dog, so check. Music? Does the perfect job of building atmosphere instead of sounding like a Hollywood movie  check. Story  there is nothing I can say here that won't spoil things but as soon as it gets moving there is no pointless banter, just one breathtaking moment after the next. Longevity? Yes, there are comics, artefacts and firefly dog-tags to find, numerous difficulty levels and the ability to upgrade Joel in a slightly-action RPG fashion to your liking.,,What I'm trying to say is that as an action game, it has it all and then some. It improves on almost all facets of an action game. Whereas others are becoming more casualized and more scripted and shorter and shorter, ND takes us in the opposite direction, with a challenging, punishing, absolutely enthralling experience that does not let up until it is over. With an original multiplayer element to boot.,I hope I have given a little more insight into why this game is so praised. Also kudos to Sony for letting ND do what they want  it has paid in spades and so it should.",normal,ps3,2013-06-19,English,39,24,10,train

By the time i'd seen them, I knew I had to buy and play this game.,,The game I got was far better even than the game I thought I was buying. Though imperfect, the combat is quite good, but where the game really shines is in the interactions between Joel and Ellie. There is a lot of emotion in them, but they are pitch perfect in it. Never have I wanted to protect a character that much in my entire history of gaming, which stretches quite a ways back now. I would look back and watch her follow me not because she ever failed, or because i had to, but because I truly cared. I laughed. I smiled my head off. I even cried a few times. Yet I never felt like they were manipulating my emotions, because there was an honesty to the story. I have to bow down to the people who made this game.,,One note, this is not a relaxing game. It is engaging. it is intense. It is stressful. It is worth every second I spent playing it. It may be too early to tell how how I'll feel about it in the future, but Ii bet that in twenty years, I'll still be telling everyone how much I loved it.

Ever! I prefer Playstation however I have been more of a 360 gamer apart from PS3 exclusives (although PS4 seems to have sorted things out for online chat etc) but no matter what your preferred console is ANY bad review for this game is just retarded and a joke on you for wasting your time. Naughty Dog amazed me with Uncharted but TLOU is better, honestly this game is just pure epic and is better then ANY game I have played in the last 10 years. Some people on here say Bioshock was better, I was a massive fan of Bioshock 1 but I actually sold Bioshock Infinite without even getting half way through the game. Anyway if you still reading reviews on this (I know I'm a bit late to write a review but I've been playing the game) just go out and buy it! I rate MGS incredibly high in my best games ever list and TLOU I actually prefer over MGS4. Don't know what else to say but a massive thank you to the whole team at Naughty Dog, I will be playing this game for years to come and buying old consoles in 10 years time to play it again.

HaydenRussell,"This game is very detailed it's outstanding. You have to play the game correctly (something Tom Chick at quarter to three obviously didn't do) which means intelligently. Sometimes you will have no choice but to stealth around the enemy with a solid stealth system and at other times stealth isn't an option and you have to smartly use every resource available to survive encounters. The game isn't hard if your smart about encounters with enemys, it can be repetitive but it firmly sets it in reality. One section of the game see's you getting a car, another see's you escaping a city, they're all sensible goals which ground the last of us in reality. The story is sweet and touching but the ending took me a while of thinking to properly appreciate it.,,But I would be lying if I didn't say the highlights of the last of us are in the story and fighting. The true highlight is exploring the world, some people say the last of us is very linear but the areas you can explore are big and full of hidden rooms and areas with loads of detail. At one point you have to walk down a street but you can enter two of the houses with multiple floors and rooms that feel lived in. I found a note from a 12 year old who over heard his parents speaking about family deaths and had to release his dog into the wild. it was sweet and when I walked downstairs I found Ellie and one of our companions playing darts and talking. It was a touching moment and the game is full of loads of moments like this as long as you look for it. If you run straight through you'll run out of ammo, die regulary, and finish the game to soon and call the game overhyped.,,Overall 10/10 this game is special and extremly well made, you need to play this game to experience it",normal,ps3,2013-06-19,English,1,0,10,train

And, just like a real apocalypse, you care for your partners and kill to survive.  Many other survival games nail the ""survive"" factor but cannot create a human-like attachment between characters.  Naughty Dog has nothing to prove and might have just made the best game of the year.  Joel and Ellie might be the best duo in years (much better than Mario and Luigi).

Penguin143,"The most outstanding game of this fading generation. Naughty Dog have created something so unique and so beautiful, and yet profound and heart-breaking at the same time. I've been made to truly care about the characters and what happens to them, in a way I didn't think was possible in a video game. This coupled with varied and thoughtful gameplay makes for a wonderful viewing/playing experience. The gameplay itself consists of stealth, problem-solving, gun-play and scavenging. These all blend together, and mean the gameplay never feels repetitive or boring. I particularly like the way the main two characters interact and work together in certain parts of the game. The wide range of landscapes, and the mix of slower paced, and sometimes hectic gameplay means you won't want to put down your controller. The graphics are truly phenomenal, making excellent use of lighting and shadows, and an insane amount of detail is embedded throughout. The collision of urban and jungle environments makes for a breathtakingly beautiful, yet believable world. In fact, it makes you question whether we need next-gen consoles with graphics like this! The music is sets the tone of the game, and does a wonderful job of injecting the right emotion into the on-screen action, both in cut-scenes and actual gameplay. All these components together create an unforgettable gaming experience. If you're after a non-stop, action packed game such as Uncharted, then perhaps you're looking in the wrong place. But if you're looking for a beautiful, immersive, emotional, character-driven, cinematic game with a compelling storyline, and amazing graphics and gameplay, then you will not be disappointed.

The game is extremely depressing at times, but also gives you life.,The combat is a really nice change up from your average third person games. The hand to hand combat, the gun play, and character movements feel great.,The voice acting also adds to the experience.,The whole concept of crafting was a nice addition.,,Some things that kind of upset me were the fact the graphics did not look or at least as great as the Uncharted games, then again, the tone of the game was completely different, and it may just be the art direction.,Another thing that really upset me was the character Joel. You learn to love him, but by the end, I got mixed feelings about him.,Other things that upset me were points such as only finding bricks and bottles to throw. With such a variety of things around the environment, I got the feel you should have been able to use them. Also while finding plenty of bags across the grounds, we could have had the chance to scavenge more.,There were plenty of pop in effects, and tears in some parts of the game. In environments to be exact.. Another thing that irritated me was the water physics. Not as good as Uncharted. But since this is my little rant on what I did not like. I really cant take points off from Naughty Dog.,Naughty Dog did a phenomenal job on this game.

The story is immersing, the world in dark, and there's a really good take on human interaction that I've only really seen in a few things, movies included.

Ershin,"This game blew my mind! It is the game I hoped it to be, with a story that is among the best in video games. The presentation is peerless and must look good even to those preferring PC gaming. On consoles, the characters and animation, along with the incredible detail of the environments, is the best I have seen this generation. Naughty Dog's incredible talent as directors/storytellers surpasses even that of theirs of game designing. The less one says of the story the better, for fear of giving anything away of this most exciting and heart-wrenching tale. It is true: the game is very dark and brutal and bloody. But this is merely consequential, considering the game's extraordinarily realistic and adult take on a post-apocalyptic world. Surviving is harsh in the world of ""the last of us"", and the white-knuckel skirmishes demonstrate this. The combat in this game is some of the best I have experienced in games, with its lack of resources, such as bullets, emphasizing skill and tactics. Stealth is a big part of the game; indeed, a number of areas allow for play through without confrontation. A note to pacifists: your characters Joel and Ellie will at times have to kill, there is no way around it. None of the characters are innocent. The world they live in simply does not allow it. Of course, as is standard with Naughty Dog productions, the soundtrack and design is terrific. The soundscape is at times evocative, scary, sad and haunting. In short: there is really nothing I can level against this masterpiece and whole heartedly recommend this title to all (mature!) gamers.

You care about characters, Joel and Ellie in particular. Through every cutscene you feel the characters and how realistically they are portrayed. They breathe, they have scars, wrinkles, glossy eyes, physical features that are lifelike. The Last of Us shines in being the most realistic fictional game I have ever played. The fungi/cordyceps concept of zombifiying people is intriguing enough. There aren't enough good things to say about this game. The gameplay is stupendous, and while it takes time getting adjusted to, it feels fluent and right when you do. There's enough variety in crafting weapons and upgrading them to spice the game up when pacing gets tough. That's one of my only problem are pacing issues, but the game is so damn good and the story is so great that you trudge through the slower spots. Often times the difficulty has unreasonable spikes, but all is forgiven, when you pass a more difficult section, the payoff and reward is well worth it. The single player itself is incredible alone and worth a buy, but the multiplayer works excellently too.

birdmannavy,"Since so many people are saying positive things about this game, I thought I'd put in my own list of negatives.  Just understand that, yes, I do love the game.  Firing from the hip here.  Enemies never Never NEVER stop to reload or run out of bullets.  More than anything about this game, it was the gameplay demos that really wowed me.  I mean, it looked like Heavy Rain's presequenced events but with total player freedom--it got me to shell out $60 to buy it new!   (Note:  I like buying games preowned if I have money burning a hole in my pocket and I'm looking for that 'Diamond In The Rough' experience I would never get playing it safe buying $60 new.)  Unfortunately, the experience of actually playing the stages is somewhat different as you'll die over and over again even on easy.  In fact, this is such the case that you'll find yourself PURPOSELY dying because the outcomes will constantly fall short of your expectations.  While less cinematically appealing (yet pretty fairly so just the same) I think the same sort of combat was done better and more believably in Splinter Cell Conviction.  I really feel it would have been better for The Last Of Us if they HAD done presequenced events--versatile presequenced events--a la Heavy Rain, but this, of course, would have taken A LOT LOT more time effort and money than just throwing a bunch of bots in a stage and saying ""HERE!""  Oh, and when I say a bunch of bots, I mean a BUNCH of bots, far more than was shown in the trailers, so many, in fact, that the game becomes a parody of itself with the bots in later stages saying ""Do you know how many of our guys that lone guy and girl killed?  70!  A HUNDRED!  An old man and a teenybopper girl!  Boy, either we are in a videogame or we are totally incompetent!""  And why, btw, do all the scavenging badguys have to be under one badguy mastermind head?  What stupid videogame bs is that?  I was imagining when I saw the demos, that they were individual clans, like the two heroes, just trying to survive.  We should be bustin' caps in or sneaking by other ""We're just good people tryin' to survive, oh, and uh, do those shoes fit me?--BAM!"" sorts.  You know, women and men, old and young.  The uninfected baddies, except at the beginning, are all male twenty-somethings mostly equipped with gruff ""Kill me, I'm a genuinely bad bad guy in a videogame!"" voices.  Where are the child soldiers, really?  Where are the elders?  Which brings me to another point, where are all the child zombies, the baby zombies--please don't split hairs, they're zombies--you think that in a game that shows a fourteen-year-old girl dying in a myriad gruesome ways when the player fubs up, do you really think in that sort of game we should be worried about killing child and elderly zombies?  Incidentally this is the same problem I had with the first-person ""terrorize the  airport"" sequence in MW2.  Where are the children and babies, the elderly, the fat, the thin, the DISABLED!  They were all the same twenty-somethings who seem to be ubiquitous in videogames.  If you don't have the backbone to do it as it really would be then don't do it at all, idiots!  *sigh*  What else?  Oh yes, the stupid ""Navigate the linear path by finding (a) a plank (b) a ladder (c) a trash bin (fully loaded!) or (d) a palate!  (there are a few others I can't think of).  This time filler nonsense bothered me even before I preordered the game.  In a post Assassin's Creed 2 landscape where anything that looks scaleable should be scaleable there is no excuse for this stupidity.  I mean, each of these things weighs a ton!  It is an absolute laugh fest the first time seeing the scrawny woman partner at the beginning hoist up a heavy heavy ladder by jump jump jump! shooting it up into the air and catching it in her hands.  It is only slightly less ridiculous when the male hero does it.  That trash can, I'm looking at you, you wouldn't roll around on those rusty, over laden wheels, up and down uneven, gravely-grassy terrain with the greatest of ease, would you?  Cormac McCarthy made this same mistake in ""The Road"" with the magic shopping cart of all-terrain prowess!  The film makers on the movie adaptation learned the hard way that THIS CAN'T BE DONE!  They ditched the cart   Now, the board, yes it weighs a ton and can't be handled the way they do, it is also straight as an arrow, unbowed, and so strong that when walked upon, stretched to the last millimeter across a gap, doesn't bend or vibrate causing certain death!  And Holy S*** talk about a laugh riot, there is a moment that Joel uses a fulcrum to lift so much concrete and mother-load wood beam he might as well have been twirling the earth on his pinky finger!  Just watch Bruce Willis try to do much less in DieHardWithAVengence.  All of what I have said in this  review is more than a mouthful, but that is not to say I don't think it a great step forward for videogames.  No, I loved it.  I say storytelling trumps story, always.",normal,ps3,2013-06-19,English,0,0,9,train
SuperZero2814,"Last of Us is a good game, probably a great game but not a perfect game. I found the support AI to be extremely frustrating especially early on when Tess just opens up gunfire on a room full of other survivors as I was trying to stealthily avoid/kill if necessary, not engage in bloody, dehumanizing gunfights. Which also brings up the nature of killing, how the game totes this aura of realism that intends to make you question whether or not it is a good idea to kill someone, which isn't evident when forced into gun-blazing scenarios where you end up punching rednecks so as to save ammo for the monsters. The concept attempted to be fresh, which I enjoyed but it ultimately came down to a post-apocalyptic zombie-survival scenario where the zombies (which act like zombies) aren't actually zombies, but in all senses still are.,,Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game wholly, it felt like I was playing the best Resident Evil game since 4 (which is still one of the best horror games of all time). It didn't strike me as a perfect 10 but it was a well polished, interesting story with great characters but a few gameplay and enemy flaws that would stop me from giving it a higher score.",normal,ps3,2013-06-19,English,20,5,7,test
AyHy,"The Last of Us is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's gritty and heartfelt and perfectly acted and eerily beautiful and all the other stuff all the 10/10 reviews say.,,But why is it being sold as a game?? I'm not sure you can call it a game at all.,,The one (and only) thing a game can offer, that a movie can't, is choice. It can put you in situations you've never been in before to let you explore your own psychology. It can offer you power, or joy, or terror, with the illusion that you are actually inhabiting, not just watching, a character.,,Joel makes the choice of a lifetime in the last act of the game. The entire world is broken. People are dying and suffering. It's not clear whether humanity is looking at an extinction level event. And he can personally fix it all. He can go down as humanity's Messiah. But to do that, he has to sacrifice the person he loves most in the world, the girl who's become a daughter to him. The little girl who loves him and trusts him unconditionally, he has to betray her and sign off on her murder.,,If this were a Bioware game or a Bethesda game, we'd be forced to make that agonizing choice. There would be consequences to our decisions; there would be multiple endings; there would be different ways the story could unfold, based on how we shape it.,,In The Last of Us, we just watch passively, helplessly, as Joel makes his decision. The game tells us ""And then Joel shot the guard in the balls. Here's a hallway full of soldiers. Clear it."",,That is not a game. That's like... being in a Skinner Box, where your reward is cutscenes rather than cheese. This is a movie that keeps putting itself on pause and saying ""Want to see more? Well, then, go swim underwater and find a pallet and shove it over to Ellie and shove it against the wall!"" It's no fun at all to do that, but we dutifully perform the task because we want to see the rest of the movie.,,So... why not just make it a movie? Why make a digital Ellen Page in the first place? Was the real one just not available?,,Sure, there are Skinner Box sections that are actually kind of fun to clear. The infected are really no fun at all to deal with, but the fights with the hunters, with the cannibals, those are fun. But they're not groundbreaking in any way. As a hybrid stealth/action shooter, I'm going to say that I think Metal Gear Solid 3 plays significantly better. Joel always feels heavy, clumsy, sluggish. Snake's more fun to play with. And MGS3 was nine years ago.,,You know, I think that picking the right media for your art is important. If a movie came out in theaters that's just an hour of watching a masterpiece of a painting while an incredible concept album played in the background  critics would universally pan it. They'd say ""This is a painting and an album. One star."",,So why is it that when a game comes out that's actually just a movie, critics respond with universal acclaim??

FoldsFive,"I'm holding my breath and crouching behind a desk. There's a Clicker in the room, his legs shuffling awkwardly as he stumbles around looking for me, his head now a bloated and blind fungal mass  years of infection have removed any vestiges of humanity he once possessed. A guttural tick echoes from his mouth as he claws at the air in desperate frustration. I'm about to breathe a sigh of relief when he passes me by but then I hear it  the sound of one of those less infected but as deadly nonetheless who has spotted me  and realise I'm going to run for it. I've only made it two or three steps before the Clicker hears me and screams after me in pursuit.,,My vision is fading from the blood loss as I slide down behind cover, hurriedly trying to craft myself a medical kit from the few scavenged remains I've pocketed. Bullets ricochet off a nearby wall as the military advance from behind cover, suspecting I'm out of ammo. Which I am. I could have made a Molotov  with the same kit, but it's too late for that now. I have no time so run towards one of them in desperation, my fist swinging towards his face.,,The Last of Us (exclusive to the PS3) is a survival horror game set 20 years after an apocalypse has devastated the Earth. And for once it's not World War III or Zombies (in as much as 28 days sort of isn't a zombie film), but in a world where the insect disease Cordyceps has spread to humanity. The remaining populace have been herded into Military controlled quarantine zones.,,The prologue  which introduces you to the character of Joel  is one of the best openings to a video-game I've encountered since Prey and Bioshock. It's very reminiscent of the opening to Zack Snyders 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead in that it introduces something quite horrific into a domestic scene  it's powerful, well written, perfectly paced and  most unusually for a video game  is phenomenally well acted. I haven't been as moved by watching anything that took such a short period of time since Pixar's Up.,,20 years later sees your character Joel eking out an existence as a smuggler, skilled in the art of survival  and travelling between the quarantine zones. A living, of sorts. And in the introduction  which does the great thing of being a tutorial that doesn't feel like a tutorial  sees you and your partner Tess press-ganged into a most unusual smuggling operation; To escort a young girl named Ellie  with a very important secret  out of the city and to safety. What follows is a breathtaking journey across a plague ravaged America where the military who seek Ellie are almost as deadly as the disease-ridden infected who wander the wastes. You'll be forced to scavenge for every piece of equipment you can get your hands on  every piece of ammunition is scarce with value beyond compare, and you'll rarely be in a position where you can plough dozens of bullets into an enemy to take him down.,,Yeah, yeah, yeah. So far, so video game. The survival horror genre has been done to death, so what makes this any different?  Any seasoned gamer must have wandered across hundreds of post apocalyptic landscapes fighting three dozen varieties of mutants/zombies/maniacs, etc.,,Well for once the script doesn't feel like it's been cobbled together by a couple of games designers who thought they were up to the task because they watched the Mad Max Box-set at the weekend. With music composed by a decent musician (Gustavo Santaolalla) as opposed to somebody who was roped into the task because they had a Casio SA-46 keyboard in the attic which still had some batteries in. With the roles acted out by a decent cast instead of dragging people in from the street or getting a developer who was in the schools performance of Oliver a decade ago.,,The Last Of Us is an immaculately presented package. As what is possibly one of the last big titles for the PS3, it's a perfect swansong  a perfectly worded eulogy for what gaming can be if the ingredients and recipe are right. I'll go out on a limb and say that it's probably one of the best video-games I've played in the last 30 years.

He probably still wouldn't admit it was art, but I think he'd have loved it as one of the closest links between cinema and gaming I've seen in a long, long time.,,It's been an odd week for PS3 and 360 owners in which it seems that Microsoft have been determined to make you all want to buy the next generation of Playstation.

Here are just some that come to mind:,,-The bottle falling over as I helped move a shelf.,-The subtle movements of curtains and flags.,-AI that made me stop thinking of this game as a typical game and treat it differently than any other.,-That the scene-setting lights in the hospital could be knocked over.,-Individual differences in scribbled handwriting on the walls and in notes.,-The piano in a hallway that wasn't there arbitrarily, but because it was close to a banquet room.,-Ellie's joke about the scientists turning into monkeys.  the animation on those monkeys!),-That Joel wanted to be a singer.,-The giraffe scene.,-The note to Bill being crumpled after getting tossed away.,-Nolan North as David,-Ellie's mood being down after seeing the deer carving.,-The room Ellie was reading the diary in.

The initial sequence is fantastic and riveting, but after skipping ahead 20 years to the setting of Boston, I felt as if the environments felt a bit unauthentic. It just seemed a bit ""unpolished"" to me. I'm not quite sure as to why, just the scenes involving Boston seemed as if they lacked the Naughty Dog ""sparkle."",,As the plot progresses however, the characters reel you in. The motion capture, facial expressions, voice acting, cutscenes- all phenomenal. You become attached to the storyline and boy is it addicting.,,Gameplay is outstanding. It is undoubtedly a Naughty Dog game. Combat, foraging, and exploration shine in this game. Crafting is a welcome feature to the post apocalyptic scenario.,,Graphics and visuals are brilliant. Every time a clicker gets too close, you are forced to watch hauntingly as it begins to devour you. It was so intense later in the game that when playing as Ellie, I had to look away.,,The sound is nothing short of amazing. Excellent score, particularly near the end of the game, the giraffe scene and the final cutscene.,,If I have any complaints about the game, they are minor. Once or twice the AI ignored one of my allies. A couple of glitchy moments but nothing major. If there's anything I would have liked to see in this game, I simply would have liked it to be longer. It took me just under thirteen hours to finish the first playthrough on normal difficulty. I know that's a decent length, but much of the story skips through parts of Joel and Ellie's journey. What happens in the land from Pittsburgh to Colorado? I enjoyed so much of the story and gameplay that I would have loved a significantly longer experience.

But for whatever reason, in this young medium, it feels so refreshing and new. The chemistry between these 2 characters. These are the stars of the show, and the game. How they evolve as characters, and most importantly as people is worthy of applaud to Naughty Dog    Cons:  -Some areas are a bit unpolished, some occasional minor glitches    -Some of the AI ranges from great, to awful    -Some of the minor things like strangling a guy whose screaming to death and not notifying other people around them is a bit hokey.

You take the role of Joel in a post-apocalyptic world, your job is to take Ellie (who I believe is the character of this generation) to a rebel group ""the Fireflies"". During your journey you will find characters that you can love and also hate. Not only Joel and Ellie's love grow, your love for these characters will also grow.

UpperGoddom,"Don't believe the people that are giving this game anything below a 7. This game is near perfect and probably one of the best of this generation. The gameplay is sharp and fresh, both online and on single player. I haven't found myself this addicted to a multiplayer game in a long time. The survival aspect stays true for the online modes and it makes the matches more intense then anything i have played. The single player is equally as astounding with perfect voice actors and a brilliant story. While a little short, they get everything across they needed to. I'm currently playing through the single player on survival mode, and let me tell you. Its hard. But with the way this game is, the hardest difficulty actually makes the game more interesting and more intense, it almost seems like that difficulty is where the game really shines. With no listening mode you are forced to be even more stealthy and more clever with your actions, and each and every scenario takes careful planning. The people that are giving this game zeroes have absolutely no merit, because no matter how you look at this game it is absolutely not anything less then a 7 or 8.",normal,ps3,2013-06-18,English,5,4,10,train
pyrofire95,"Right out of the starting gate the game looks amazing, surprising that gaphics can still impress me this late in the console cycle. The game starts in a calm way and gets the player connected to the characters so you care for them throughout the entire game. Within the first 10 of gameplay it starts to set up the mood giving you fear of the unknown followed by the death, destruction, the infected, and lastly the people. The game has a great supporting cast that you get to know while you travel with fighting opponents developing a trust and friendship, letting the player adapt the feeling the characters give. One part i particularly like is through all the fear and terror the girl Joel travels with, Eli, sometime makes drumming or guitar noises suddenly illuminating the mood giving a light to the ugly yet beautiful world. Gameplay always keep you trying to come up with different ways of passing an obstacle, gradually giving the player more weapons to play with.

scoutwags,"The Last of Us is a masterfully crafted work. The story is not about the cross country journey, it is not about the world that the infection has created, its about people. Nowhere have I seen better writing in terms of believable dialogue and character interaction before. To those who have played Uncharted, and are thus doubtful about the constant 10s, rest assured it is a vastly different feeling. Where uncharted had serious dissonance between the violent and cold blooded Drake and the wacky and charming Drake, The Last of Us informs all of the play through characterization. All of the violence is brutal and harsh, and the game responds to that. It is a tale that only a game could tell, building an admittedly obvious plot into a 17 hour emotional narrative. the game has its moments of intensity, and  then falls back into thorough scavenging, a slow walk through exquisitely detailed houses and towns. The flow is finely tuned to perfection, and leaves the player engrossed in the story. In total, The Last of Us is a work of art, one that anyone who enjoys a strong emotional experience should play.",normal,ps3,2013-06-18,English,6,4,10,train

Kenmei,"Lovely game and will be a contender for game of the year for sure, The Last of Us is not exactly about the story but the journey for the main characters, Joel and Ellie. The story has quite a few twists and turns and the combat is really well done. Don't expect an indepth fighting system or gunplay as that's not what this game is about. The combat is well done but there's not much there in the first place, which is good as that leaves them more time to focus on the journey of the characters. The development of both Joel and Ellie is very well done and the characters you meet up with on the way are excellently crafted and, when they eventually leave, they will get you to remember their presence for the rest of the game. This game is very dark and depressing. Don't go into it thinking things will go well for Joel and Ellie because nothing goes well for them. You will definitely love the game but know that you won't feel happy at the end of it. It lasts for about 12 hours and you'll definitely remember the whole thing.

The gameplay starts really slow for the first hour you'll be frustrated because you don't have it down yet, and then just puts you right in it and you're just wrapped up in the story you won't want to quit.  The music is great, the character development is the best I've seen.  This is no Hollywood Uncharted game like a Jason Stratham movie this is like Breaking Bad, The Killing, the Walking Dead, it's just fantastic.

Darkspirit_,"In a market that is filled with bland, repetitive and copy paste type games, it's nice to own a game that dares to be different. While some things might seem obvious, a lot of stuff is not. Most people will miss a lot of the fine details that are present within the game. Such as the many hidden Easter eggs and lore.,Even characters will have their own surprises. Naughty dog does Survival horror justice, it depicts it's idea on how a post Apocalyptic world would look like, and does a good job doing so.,,From start to finish you get to learn about the world, you get to know the characters and watch them grow as individuals. To me It was way more than a mere cinematic experience with gameplay elements.  I felt a connection with the characters, I put myself in their shoes and asked myself what I would have done in certain situations. This is the first game since Bioshock 1 (""Would you kindly"" message) that has tested my morals, my basic instincts/impulses and made me question my own logic behind the decisions I've made. Towards the end of this game I felt so connected to the characters that I would literally put myself in harms way just to protect Ellie, even though I knew she was just an A.I I felt as if I needed to be there for her.,,One of the fun parts of this game is the way you struggle to get supplies, it's one of those games that ""kinda forces"" you to scavenge for resources or find those little treasures (not really necessary, but it does make your life easier). But it's not something that you will hate, it's not some tedious task. It's something that (at least in my experience) you will want to do, I spent hours on end, just looking around for pendants, comic books, health packs, crafting resources, tool kits, supplements and much more. I sat down reading notes, trying to learn as much as I could, always looking for clues as to what happened here, what happened to this family/person, trying to solve riddles such as why the world is the way it is, and I loved every second of it.,,I spent 16 hours  on this game on my first run through, most people will also finish the game at around this time. For anyone rushing the game it may last 8-10 hours on normal difficulty, but in doing so you miss so much of the game. I recommend you take your time, search every little inch of the world and have fun doing so.,,The Last of Us may not be for everyone, but it's a game that gave me an awesome experience that I will not soon forget.

We watch as these two grow closer and form a bond with each other to the point where Joel would give up everything for her.  The whole game is simply put, a mindblowing experience.  The only games that top this is my personal all time favorite series Metal Gear Solid, but that being said this is a close second.

FallenHeroAM,"The Last of Us is not a game, in the same way a book is not a magazine. And The Last of Us feels like a damn good book. I went in to this game expecting another Telltale's The Walking Dead, I expected The Last of Us to drag drearily forward with a tale that would leave me depressed for a week. But at every point in the game where it hit that emotionally rotten rock, it bounced back with some of the most legitimate feel good moments I have ever experienced in this form of entertainment. So much so that more than once when Joel would make a light chuckle or crack a smile, I found myself doing the same just a second before he did. The writing is beautiful and the characters I met along my journey felt like real companions.,The world always felt bigger than it really was, and the level design was crafted so masterfully that I found myself going the right direction without ever looking at a map or searching for the way to go, with one exception. There is a part in the game where you reach a hotel and there are multiple floors. Being that it is a hotel, every room, hallway, and balcony looks kind of the same, I spent much longer than I would have liked searching for the way to go, and even when the on screen hint popped up I was still unsure of where I was supposed to be heading. It wasn't until I spotted a fairly hidden stairwell that I was back on track. It was immersion breaking to say the least, but it was also a very rare and isolated incident.,The only other problem I could foresee with The Last of Us is it's difficulty. Those who aren't good at stealth games, will struggle a lot with the heavy stealth moments. Players who want to go guns blazing will find themselves out of bullets and cornered. Those who don't want to scavenge will find themselves low on resources and annoyed. These same difficulties are what crafted an amazing experience for me. This game is very niche. Don't let the high scores fool you, this game is not for everyone. But I recommend everyone at least try it.,I have not played the multiplayer yet, but it wouldn't affect my score regardless. 10/10",normal,ps3,2013-06-18,English,2,1,10,train

However, I have been a fan of third-person action games for the strong majority of my life and it is my honest opinion that this game does it on par with the best, which is no surprise since it was created by Naughty Dog, who are no strangers to the third-person action genre. No matter how you view the gameplay though, the narrative is the most finely crafted story I have yet to experience in its medium. Frankly, I can only hope that games in the future take notes on how to create narratives half as good as The Last of Us featured. Joel and Ellie have inevitably been added to my list of characters I actually cared for, which is regrettably a small list.

There isn't a studio out there putting nearly as much care and love into what they do that Naughty dog does. So much care has been put into the characters and story, so much subtle and beautiful animation detail into the faces in the cutscenes. Seeing the relationship change between Joel and Ellie was breath taking and had me shouting at my TV in anger at Joel.,,I know what you're thinking... Post apocalyptic, zombie like creatures, no Nathan Drake... Well stop! I understand your pre-conceived notions of how these games are. This isn't the walking dead, it's not Fallout and it certainly isn't Uncharted although the game mechanics share a lot of similarities. The gun play in this game is vastly improved from what Naughty Dog has done before and although sometimes the AI will prove me wrong the AI is much more intelligent. But most importantly killing the AI in this game is more meaningful as you feel like you're protecting Ellie and will do whatever it takes to get her through this world safely.,,As a final note I would suggest you play through this without caring for trophies as you will not get the bulk of them until the end of your third play through. I understand the appeal of trophies as I wear my platinum's for all of Naughty Dog's games with pride. But after finishing the game on hard you will only have 8% of the trophies.

The story is predictable and while it looks pretty, there are definitely better looking games out for PS3 at the moment. The crafting and upgrade systems are shallow and disappointing, as is the looting, but then, one should be mindful that this is a shooter, not an RPG. Some areas have multiple, clever ways of dispatching enemies, but all too often the player is simply fighting off wave after wave of enemies, and it get boring quickly.

Crafting is an interesting addition and translates well into the online multiplayer, which is good but overall it's the same team deathmatch setup you see in nearly every shooter these days.,,My main problem is the way the story is forced on you. You can skip some cutscenes, but it takes four button presses to do so. Some sections require player input but all you do is walk forward slowly and maybe press a button to progress the story. This isn't so bad on your first play through but feels like torture on a second when you know what's going to happen but can't change it.,,It's a perfectly playable third person shooter if that's what your looking for.

jackn,"Well, The Last Of Us is like no other game I have ever played. In my opinion this video game rivals the best that Cinema and Television have to offer.,,The gameplay is slow-paced; the majority of time I spent meandering down beautifully ruined city streets, rummaging through cupboards in deserted houses or just standing in awe of the stunning environment. For this reason I can understand why not everyone will love this game. Action is sparse and focuses more on stealth than impressive set-pieces, but when you do come across the enemy the combat is tense and often brutal.,,The AI is not without its faults, however, the human enemies react how you would expect humans to react. At every opportunity they will flank you, taking advantage of the complex mazes that Joel and Ellie often find themselves in. When searching they will act as a team as a team and call reinforcements if you are spotted. But some quirks can ruin moments ingame. Often your allies will run out in front of the enemy who will not even notice and (of course) they will get underneath your feet in doorways and narrow corridors.,,The Last Of Us is gorgeous  The best looking game of this generation. Cityscapes go on for miles, under-siege by nature. The streets are littered with rubbish, abandoned cars and foliage (think of I Am Legend). Many houses are explorable and the detail is immense. It feels authentic and everywhere you look something will catch your eye; whether it be an old family photograph, a letter to loved ones or just posters on walls of bedrooms. All of which serve to flesh out the story and enhance it greatly.,,Where The Last Of Us shines is storytelling. The story goes to every extreme, often telling of great humility then depicting horrific scenes born out of desperation. The game is centered around Joel and Ellie. Their relationship is perfect. While on this huge journey their relationship evolves into one lof a father and daughter. I loved experiencing this and grew to care about both characters in a way no other video game has ever achieved. They survive hugely traumatic events and you watch as the bond deepens between them. Somewhere along your travels Joel or Ellie might stumble across an object that triggers a memory. This can lead to little cutscenes, giving the player an insight into their pasts. Throughout their journey across America they meet a diverse group of individuals. Every character encountered is unique and genuinely interesting.,,Overall, when I completed the game i felt quite emotionally drained. Similar to if i had just watched an epic movie. I felt as if I had myself experienced the horrors but also the beautiful relationship that sprang up between Joel and Ellie. The Last Of Us is a story about humanities darkest hours. The acts humans perform when there are no rules and survival is anything but assured. In the midst of all that Joel and Ellie bring to light the best qualities humans have to offer. Thank you, Naughty Dog, for the greatest Story I have ever experienced in a video game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,1,1,10,train

SomeGuy182,"This is the game I've been waiting decades for. This is it, the game that I feel was able to immerse me in an experience like no other medium can offer. We are gamers for a reason and we do this for the emotional connection to the characters we play as, we are responsible for the actions that unfold on the screen and we develop relationships with these characters. I'm certain to say that this game is revolutionary in the idea of involving us directly within the environment we've been put in. Just play this game and experience it, the idea of being scarce on items, the tension of having a group of hunters flanking you from every corner, the panic that comes from infected relentlessly charging you and knowing a clicker kills you in an instant, this game will blow your mind. You will cry, you will panic, you will take deep breaths as enemies close in on you, but one thing you won't feel is disappointment. Do yourself a favor and experience this.

Gameflame,"This game is the best ps3 game on the market graphically and story wise. The depth and detail of this game continue to stun me as I fumble through the post apocalyptic U.S.A. and as I figure things out I'm scared of my surroundings in which I usually do not feel safe. While there are downsides to scavenging for supplies, there are upsides to it, such as the fact that you can upgrade your weapons. The game does a great job at immersing you and sucking you into the world as is in 2033, the time which the game takes place. The rewards of beating the game are like those of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves because of the way you can make the environment change. While these don't parallel to the cheats in Uncharted 2, Naughty Dog's graphics department is not low budget, with three art styles. The premise of the game is really to get to know a 14 year old girl that you are delivering to a band of survivors and bond with her in your adventures. The multiplayer in this game is also immersive because you are the leader of a faction and you must forage for supplies for them and keep your new colonization safe. It puts you in the place of a survivor going on raids and trying to eliminate rival gangs. Game on.",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,1,1,10,train
aikoyamamato,"Naughty Dog hit this one out of the park. Absolutely stunning. I have rarely experienced a video game that was so....satisfying. With an emotional, 20 minute introduction this game stole my heart and refused to let go. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I got scared, I panicked, I loved and I hated. It was a  of emotions that went out with a bang; the effects of the ending linger in me still.,,Right from the beginning it is apparent how much work went into this masterpiece. Every area, every object and every character is rendered in exquisite detail. Small things like a reflection in a glossy portrait to a bandage you freshly placed on a wounded body all add up to an experience that feels ultimately...real. You feel the desperation of this broken world .,,To complement this you are given, in true Naughty Dog fashion, an amazing cast of characters. Every character is unique with his or her own circumstances. You come to like character and hate them almost immediately. Joel and Ellie in particular portray a natural chemistry that you rarely see even in cinema. Ashley Johnson's performance of Ellie sinks it home, showing you just how amazing mo-cap can be.,,Almost overshadowing these strong points is a breathtaking score by Gustavo Santaolalla. Naughty Dog could not have picked a better composer. Gustavo's acoustic guitar chills you to the bone and each track is ultimate crafted to deliver each scene perfectly. The sound effects as well help blur the lines between reality and fantasy. The clicking sounds of a Clicker serves as an awesome example of small sound effects causing real emotion. You will panic. A lot.,,Overall it is just really difficult to put words into what this game makes you feel. If you have a PS3 and have not played this game, you are doing yourself a disservice. Even if it doesn't affect you the same way it has me there is no denying the experience being worthwhile. Do it.",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,13,11,10,train
Vidyafan9999,"This game was a fantastic surprise for me, and even though I haven't finished it yet (I'm nearing the end), I know I won't forget this game easily. First of all, let me say this: if you are that kind of gamer that just want non stop action, explosions, and huge set pieces, don't even think about getting this game and get one of the many brainless shooters out there. For everyone else, this game is a treat. It alternates quiet, atmospheric moments to intense fights, both against humans and infected enemies all the time, with incredibly good pacing. During the quieter sections, it's fantastic to just explore searching for supplies, the environments are beautifully detailed, the designers probably spent weeks putting every single element in place. The combat is intense, brutal and rewarding, especially against the infected, it's frantic and challenging, especially when playing on hard. The sound design is equally top notch, for example in areas with rain, the rain will sound different depending where it falls, on metal, glass, concrete etc. The sound design is truly spectacular and I highly recommend having good heaphones or a nice surround system, it's insanely immersive. The music is rare, but when it starts, it does so masterfully and the already exceptional immersiveness is increased 10x. My only complaint is that the stealth is a bit unrefined. Enemy AI is mostly great, but there is the occasional bug, which is inevitable. The reason I don't give 10/10 is that they could have optimized the AI further and created a more refined stealth experience. The story is rather simple but very well executed,gripping and character development is excellent. Voice acting is fantastic too.,The multiplayer was the icing on the cake, I didn't even care about it, but it's solid, has a different pace compared to the various shooters out there, and focuses on stealth, and teamwork. I'm having lots of fun with it, but you really need a few ""bros"" to play it with, coordinating your attacks and everything, but it's still enjoyable even with random people.,,Bottom line, the game is excellent, it delivers in every single area, is incredibly immersive, the plot is solid, the character development is excellent, the sound design is probably the best this gen. The very few AI screwups are rare and don't hamper the experience at all. If you can appreciate a slower paced, more intimate experience compared to the average shooter or Uncharted game, which rewards careful approaches, exploration, stealth, and item conservation, this game is excellent. If you want an explosive rollercoaster with 1000+ bullets shot per minute, look elsewhere.",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,5,4,10,train

However, one thing is crystal clear from doing any search of reviews on the game: The Last of Us is an amazing game.  The graphics, sound, acting and story are everything folks have come to expect from Naughty Dog and more.

Search for reviews on this game and you will find the same results everywhere.

hsapin,"The Last of Us is a marvel of the video game medium. The story is integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, and the mechanics are actually reinforcing unlike many games that try to tell the story of a character who is good on the inside, but then a mass murderer when you take control of them. Joel is a masterfully written character who truthfully displays a moral grey area, while Ellie represents the last remaining hope of humanity, while still being a deep and likable. The supporting cast also never happens to fall into any cliches or archetypes. The sound design is among the best I've ever heard with impeccable voice acting along with realistic weapon and enemy sounds. Visually the game is equally marvelous with gorgeous graphics and beautiful enviornment design. From a presentation standpoint, The Last of Us is essentially unrivaled and achieves something that most games can only dream of. Enemy encounters are dynamic and engrossing while combat is decisively tense while still reflecting the tone set by the story with it's gritty and intimate encounters, but stealth is king as with limited supplies you must conserve as much as possible, and items are crafted in real time. With every encounter, you have to really think about what you want to do and how you want to do it. Do you want to flank a guy out then go and strangle him, or do you want to take a more guns blazing approach? This is just one of the many scenarios you will face. Exploration is both encouraged and rewarding in The Last of Us due to the interesting collectables, items needed for crafting, and various upgrades spread through out. Sprinkled through out the game there are also adventure elements such as retrieving ladders or making makeshift bridges to get you around your environment. The Last of Us doesn't do anything particularly new or innovative, but does everything it sets out to with flying colors. Overall the gameplay sets yet another milestone  in what it means to survive in a video game and is mechanically amazing. There is also a multiplayer aspect to the game which adds a good bit to the overall package. The multiplayer tells a small story of its own while keeping the same tense and stealthy gameplay of the singleplayer, and for that The Last of Us should be applauded.,,Although it may seem by that I have nothing negative to say about the game by now, but that is a false notion as I don't believe that The Last of Us is a flawless game. In a package so pretty, even the smallest blemish sticks out sorely. Here and there, texture pop in occurs and shadows may look terrible which brings down the overall presentation slightly. Companion AI is also not perfect as sometimes while sneaking your companions may walk directly into an enemy's line of sight, or make a very loud noise and still not alert an enemy. The only other thing that may be a problem is the chase scenes. In this game, I feel as if chase sequences where you are expected to run from an enemy or horde of enemies go against many of the mechanics that are more heavily established. I personally feel as if I may have missed some of the collectables due to sections of the game where I had absolutely no choice but to run as I did not get to go and explore some of the areas that the enemies appeared from. If I truthfully did mis some collectables due to scenes like this, then I believe that is a problem with game design.,,Even with these few and somewhat nitpicky negative points, The Last of Us is still an amazing game and in my opinion one of the greatest games to ever be made. It marks a great leap forward for videogame presentation as a whole while also being extraordinarily enjoyable and rewarding to play.",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,11,7,10,train

Somehow Naughty Dog were able to push the PS3 beyond what Uncharted 2 & 3 did and managed to make the best looking PS3 game hands down.  Quite honestly, this is next-gen game on the PS3 and it is breathtaking.  Naughty Dog has also crafted a beautiful, emotional story that engages you from the very beginning and doesn't let go until you reach a very emotional conclusion.  The personality injected into Joel and Ellie is awe-inspiring.  These aren't just characters in another video game; these are living breathing people that you care about deeply.  Moving on, everything else about the game is top-notch.  The A.I. is challenging and extremely smart.  Quite a few times I thought I was safe behind cover, when an enemy would sucker punch me and cause me to rethink my strategy.  The music is brilliant and used to great effect.  The sound design overall is amazing, especially at creating suspense.  The ""Clickers"" noise is especially eerie and you can't help but freeze and hide as soon as you hear it.  The voice acting is also superb from the entire cast.  There are a couple of glitches or oddities, like friendly NPCs walking through you or the fact that if your character is hiding, enemies will not react to your friendly NPCs running around looking for cover.  These are forgivable though, considering that they are no such things as perfect games.  Regardless, this game deserves a perfect score.  One of the best games of the year.

JoelDelsin996,"This is definitely GOTY. Besides the stunning motion capture acting, graphics, and solid gameplay, this game delivers an intense, emotional, and engaging experience. The best part about this game is its story. This is not farcry3 or bioshock infinite where you are killing the same, predictable, AI every time while scavenging for  extra ammo,  or collectibles. This is a game where every decision you make has an immediate consequence. You cannot survive if you don't pay attention to your surroundings, your ammo, and your craft-able items. This sense of urgency and fear at being overwhelmed only adds to the  superb and engaging story. There was never a moment while playing (story and multiplayer) that i wasn't on the edge of my seat, chewing my nails and wondering what was going to happen next. This experience was essentially like reading a really fantastic book, but you were not only seeing it, but partaking in it. Sure the plot was somewhat predictable, that didn't retract from my experience or enjoyment because it was predictable because of the game's context (zombie apocalypse) not because of any lack of originality. When playing this game (Story or Multiplayer) you are always on your toes, you are always conscious of what you are doing, and what is happening around you. This isn't COD where you can run in guns blazing and live to tell the tale. This is the Last remnants of society. There is not unlimited ammo. Your survival depends on how effective you can manage your limited resources and skills. You cant let any second of your time go to waste. This game is the most engaging game i have played in ages, and i would recommenced it to any gamer (of age, this is a brutal game that had a LiveLeak survivor like me cringing) who is willing to experience some of the most innovative and engaging experiences in their gaming career. You don't have to be an avid gamer to enjoy this.

lucslade,This is a game that brings together many familiar ideas from the great games of my childhood and pulls them all off spectacularly well. The voice acting/motion capture is the best I've seen in a video game & the writing top notch to match. There is much to be found in the wonderful tale. P.S.

GameInterpreter,"There isn't much to say about The Last of Us besides the fact that it's a thrill ride that can keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end; the premise itself could be said to be a cliched had it not brought an extreme amount of emotion to me throughout the bonding moments between the protagonists; Joel and Ellie. Along with the happiness that could be offered with their conversations tears can also be provoked from the games opening that may possibly be the saddest opening to any story that I have ever seen; this being said about the games beginning the tension and suspense that is felt from the games final moments are also the strong point for The Last of Us while being just as emotional as it's opening moments if not even more. Enough about the games emotional points the key point of the gameplay is to forge to survive and craft your weapons to your best advantage; Naughty Dog succeeds on a larger level than I could have ever though possible after playing through scavenging for tools and scraps to craft several items that are required to complete your journey west, such as shivs, first-aid kits, and even molotov Along with the great crafting system something that constantly plagues games in our modern market is the poor artificial intelligence, but with The Last of Us this will only be a problem for someone who gets upset from being outmaneuvered by a computer controlled bot as this game proves to have AI that works together to find a tactical advantage over the player.

Montana0307,"-Delete my other review i give tlou a 10/10 not 4!!!,,Ok first off where to start in response to Calvincrack you have some major issues son....ADD probably the main one...to say these characters are mildly fleshed out & your not the only person but in going to pick on you anyway....mildly fleshed out are you actually smoking crack then? Did you play the game with your eyes shut & the volume on mute or something? This of all points is by far the most ridiculous thing I've read in these hater reviews!!! Joel & Ellie are by far two of the best developed characters of any game in history, the fact that you build a connection to both characters & develop a sense of protectiveness over Ellie is absolutely astounding for a video game & it shows how far the industry has matured unlike your brain. I mean did you really play the game with a preconceived notion that you won't like it just because it got 27 10/10s or are you also a bioshock infinite fan? I've played hundreds of games & character wise nothing compares!! If you paid attention, listened to every word spoken, interacted with every optional conversation then there's no way you could say these characters are underdeveloped it's plain stupidity on your part! I guess your just a COD kid who has no clue as to what makes a good game & good story....maybe there wasn't enough explosion for you to get excited over!! Oh and because there isn't a scripted set piece every 30secs maybe that's why you didn't enjoy it....BUT this is where you made the mistake of assuming this was uncharted2 because its not!! No where near because its not meant to be....it's a completely different tone & genre! This game is about subtle details, the ambience of a post apocalyptic world, the sheer beauty of the world that's been created is phenomenal on (7yr old hardware-and people moan about a few popups or graphical glitches here & there?!!nonsense/nitpicking fools...name 1 game with no errors...ye thought so) ...each room tells a story of the deceased, there's so many finite details in this game that it blows my mind every time I find something new!! The gameplay is also amazing, a guy said its all the same? What the? There's melee, melee with bats,wood,machetes etc multiple weapons-guns,rifles,bows etc & there's items you craft which adds like another 3-4 methods to dispatch enemies...I guess the guy that complained was just terrible at the game if all he did was punch every enemy!! The sound is pitch perfect & quite haunting from the clickers etc....another major beef I have with haters is that they think this is a survival zombie game...ND never said that they never titled it a zombie game? The infected are infected they don't die & come back to life they are infected & the cordyceps take control of the brain-people say this isn't an original idea but compared to every zombie game ever released which has a generic zombie I would say its definitely unique!! I think it's fantastic! I don't think I'll ever play a game that gripped me or made me have an emotional connection to the characters like this ever again in my life! Unless naughty dog pull it off again! But I doubt this can be topped!! I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who has a decent IQ, doesn't play COD....& doesn't rely on explosions & bullet time effects to think a game is cool, who want an amazing story driven game, to see two characters be developed masterfully & to see the end outcome & just experience a post apocalyptic America looking gorgeously crafted on the PS3!!",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,7,4,10,train

Some of you seem to write your negative review and somewhere in there write how Bioshock Infinite is a better game...come on,  are we really going to take you people seriously. Clearly biased. Besides Bioshock infinite has a score of 9.4/8.5 so your argument is invalid. Giving this game a 0 is unnecessary. You clearly have a sour taste in your mouth.

imfromimgur,"I'll start of by saying that the game is fantastic, it really is. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it's my favourite single player game so far. Multiplayer, not so much. The story is extremely well written, well executed and incredibly engaging. From the get go you feel emotionally intertwined with the characters, you feel what they feel. No other game has taken me through so many emotions, whether that's scared, happy, saddened, excited or just  my pants.,The last Of Us delivers breathtaking scenery. The world is beautifully crafted, with an immense amount of depth. Back stories, visible events (as in, blood trails left on the floor from a fight) and decay are everywhere. The representation of a post apocalyptic world is second to non. The world is greatly explorable, giving a feeling of a non-linear path even though it actually is. You have optional mini side quests for loot and goodies (which I would highly recommend doing!),The game is scary, no doubt; however, it doesn't let that over-ride the story. There is a great balance of horror and non horror story driven elements. The enemies are menacing and deadly, and in great supply, but the game does allow for breather periods where you can freely explore and truly take in the gorgeous scenery.,I can honestly say that in all my years of gaming, nothing has quite touched me like this. I may of only spent 12 hours playing, but them 12 hours where fantastic from start to finish. Nothing about this game, in my eyes is negative (apart from fishy AI at times). If you were considering picking this game up, I would suggest that if you like a challenge, with horror elements and a brilliant story, you should snap at this game and enjoy it.

The writing is fantastic, the game play is top notch, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous, and the voice acting is some of the best in the business. I didn't think that we'd get these kind of graphics with dated hardware but this game is a testament to the PS3's power. For anyone looking for a one of a kind experience in gaming, do yourself a favor and purchase this game. Naughty Dog has done it again and should be hailed as a top tier developer.

(not content wise, mind you) but mechanic wise, from watching trailer after trailer and game-play video after game-play video (prior to release), I felt like the game was more serious (towards weapons) then it currently is.,,For example, there is a game-play video (from E3 2012) (one of the firsts, and it's obvious they made some changes to the story and the way you get to certain points are different then the video) but it was the game-play that stood out (in the video), bullets were scarce and the fighting seemed extremely realistic (as you point a gun to someone who doesn't have one (they will act all scared and flee or beg for their life), I have not seen this once (even at the same location).

The gameplay in fact is a good one, you will find so much to do in The Last of Us (crafting weapons, getting upgrades) the fight's whit button smash/panic scene's feel's great and the combat systems is what you can spect  meele weapons are easy to use but firearms will requiere more practice and that is good, because in RL shooting a gun/rifle is not as easy as most shooters/fps want to make us belive) Walking/running/climbing/swimming fells so natural and so real BUT there are some BIG issues whit the game mechanics. The most shocking/disappointing one is the cover/stealth system. I find myself many times not being discovered by enemy's even when my dumb AI partner walked in front of the enemy. My AI parner talking to me/other guy in a zone where there are sound sensitive enemies lurking around and amazingly they dont discover us  if your character makes noise/walk in front of an enemy that is a different story). So this is a big big... no no no  HUGE problem in the stealth game mechanics/partner AI system that must be solved right away by Naugty Dog.,,Replay: 8/10 It's almost imposible to max upgrade your weapons/abilities in one gameplay, so this add replayability to The Last of Us, also the beautiful enviroments of the game/amazing story really invite us to take our controller and play again this title in the New Game+ mode.,,Music/Voice Acting: 10/10  The voice acting in The Last of Us is simply amazing!!!

the1mike1man,"As much as the game's presentation is fantastic, I can't help but escape the feeling that for most of the game, I'm playing a film. This screams great things for the graphics, level design and voice acting, however not being in the action can make the game feel slow and, at times, there is no real urgency to press on. On top of this, the game's difficulty appears to increase dramatically in the first few hours of the story; after complaining about one Clicker accompanied by three or four Runners (not because I thought it was too much, Clickers just require an element of tactical play), I was shortly presented with a situation in which I was expected to fend off upwards of three Clickers. Dying in what is effectively one hit can be frustrating, although it becomes quite rewarding when you achieve what you set out to in situations dealing with the infected.,The Last of Us is without a doubt the best looking console game to have existed, and the immersive gameplay does well to keep you interested in the story.

Nednerb,"If The Walking Dead and I am Legend had a baby it would be The Last of Us.  You can truly appreciate  the work done here by Naughty Dog.  Their heart and soul was poured into this game and it shows it.  The story was written by writer of both Uncharted 1 and 2 and he delivers magic once again.  The introduction is arguably in the top 10 and the story continues to impress until its final moments.  The characters are well designed and the use of experienced actors help convey the fear the protagonists are going through as they adventure into the most detailed environment seen in a game to date.  Stealth and kicking in the front door guns blazing fans rejoice!  The player determines how they want to take on the game whether it be whipping out the firearm and taking on the Clickers head on or sneak around the corner and Shiv them to death, the choice.. ultimately yours.  The use of physical objects is a great touch, however one could argue that there would be more out there then a single brick,  a glass bottle, a baseball bat and a two by four to meddle with in a post apocalyptic world.  The scarcity of bullets makes the player count their chickens prior to an engagement, a rather nice touch.  The sound is top notch turn up the volume and get ready to jump in fright.  The music is perfect.  There is not much you can criticize this game is the overall package.  If the end of the world was from a zombie attack, The Last of Us is a believable representation of what might happen.

CalvinCrack,"i would compare this game not to watching paint dry, but to actually watching a house being painted.  sure, there's action, but it's pretty boring.  I feel bad for that guy at Polygon who reviewed this a 7.5 and took all the heat.  I was ready to see that guy sacrificed in a volcano pre-release, but now that i've played most of the game, he was right on the money.  this is an average to below average shooter masked with amazing production value.  Uncharted 2 is one of my favorite games, and this comes across as a slow, boring, neutered version of that concept based entirely around its so-so stealth mechanic.  The story is cliche, the characters are mildly developed to put it mildly, and the gameplay mechanics aren't fun enough to keep me entertained moment to moment.  If you are a big Survival Horror fan like me and were hoping this game would be the second coming, i would lower your expectations.  The game's ""survival"" tendencies are completely at odds with its own pacing.  On one hand, the temptation is to pixel hunt to make sure you have enough supplies, but by doing this, you end up exploring big empty environments and DRAMATICALLY slow down the pace of an already slow game.  And what's worse is that I've felt flush with supplies the whole time, ever since i adapted to the game's ""bullet allowance"".   Pixel hunting works in the Silent Hill games (for instance) because they have an overall labyrinth quality:  your'e searching for a place to go, which requires finding keys and puzzle pieces.  It's all built around the search, and finding a new object is its own reward. The Last of Us just asks you to scrounge for little ""scissor emblems"" while taking you on rails from one locale to the next.  Most of which are very straightforward areas by the way.  And when you are suddenly confronted by a large environment in TLOU, it's just stressful.  Like: there's no puzzle to solve, there's just dudes to shoot and where the  is the next car to crawl on top of and get to the next alley way full of cars.   if i sound sour it's because the game has so much potential.",normal,ps3,2013-06-17,English,27,7,6,train

It truly IS the masterpiece everyone is telling you it is. I picked it up day one and have since gotten through my first of many playthroughs. The story is drama perfection. It feels completely organic never hammed up or forced upon you. The subtlety is the true beauty of this game the way the environments lighting and dialogue convey tension, emotion and the gravity of the situation. I was literally jumping at my Tv when I feared for the characters lives. The gameplay is simple survival. Every shot counts, stealth is king and taking no prisoners leaving no one to come after you all hammer home the direness that the world has fallen into, where every moment may be cut short by infected or a lead pipe across the face. Naughty Dog does not glamorize violence, or collecting ladders to climb. It is a love-note to realism in video games. Everywhere You go tells a story if You're observant enough to read them nothing is in vain nothing is pointless  filler. Everything has purpose everything means something. Switching direction to address not anything about the game but people reviewing it.,,Whatever faults others have found that i've read in other reviews critic and user are, to put it bluntly untrue. I suspect they nit-picked the game to death to rebel against the generally incredible praise. For whatever morbid satisfaction having a different opinion from anyone else would hold. A few of the things I've read are downright lies. I.e. a user reviewer attacked the A.i. saying your companions would make too much noise screwing him over. Which is funny because enemies don't even register your companions when You're sneaking. Which is a little odd because You can have ellie basically cuddling a hunter. But I cannot count this against the game because having to sneak about and account for an A.I. You have no control over would botch several areas of the game directly or indirectly... back on topic. I've read that the graphics aren't that great.(****) or the voice acting is so-so(****) or the story is mediocre(****) This game from a technical perspective is a masterpiece. the voice acting WILL make you tear up once or twice. you WILL care about these characters unless you have a heart of stone. And the story WILL grip you. The world will immerse You and the enemies will terrify you. Enemy A.i. is competent and cunning to boot. Infected have human hearts and minds deep inside of them and are horrifying to just sit unnoticed and observe them jerk and twitch about sobbing, mumbling, trying to form words............

Lyquified,"Now, I don't usually play single-player games, but I had heard many great things about this one. It has to be by far the best campaign I have played of any game. Not only was it character driven, but simply showed you what the current generation of consoles, especially the PS3, can still do. I'm a PC gamer myself, so I had a lot of expectations for this. Yes, the graphics aren't comparable to what they would look like on a gaming PC, however for how old the PS3 actually is, you really have to be ignorant to deny that the graphics didn't look stunning in the game. Everything from things on the table such as CD racks, bean bags, and other common household items were given so much detail, even though it wasn't needed. It really adds that extra ""oomph"" to the game. Now to talk about the game-play itself, speechless. I am usually one to criticize games very quickly about how fake something is, or how how something doesn't look fun, or whatever it may be. However I did not feel that way about this game at all. Most people who gave this game a low score either weren't interested in the story at all, or just simply wanted to beat another game so they can say that they finished it. Though, you have to play the game on hard difficulty to get the full experience, because anything less doesn't do the game justice. To end it, Joel and Ellie feel like real characters, characters that you know and can easily connect to. They bring you into their lives almost as if you're right next to them the whole time. It's truly a masterpiece, and it will go down in history as one of the greatest feats of the gaming industry. None of this would have been possible if it weren't for Naughty Dog, props to your whole team for making one of the best games I have ever played!",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,5,4,10,test
Tank238,"This game is a masterpiece. I don't know how else to put it. Much like Telltale Games' hit The Walking Dead, this game focuses on a character-driven story. These characters are, in true Naughty Dog fashion, brought to life by sharp visuals, spot-on voice acting, and abundantly clever writing. From start to finish, these character interactions never feel forced or out of place. Why else would I have played it almost nonstop over the weekend? Sure, the story isn't anything new  apocalyptic stories are a dime a dozen nowadays  but the way in which it's told is what you come for. People seeking yet another brainless point-and-shoot FPS won't like it, but who cares about them.,,In terms of gameplay, the controls are similar to Uncharted, but overall the game encourages you to play as if it's Metal Gear Solid. You can sneak around and completely avoid enemy engagements, or just go ahead and kill them either stealthily or loudly if you've been spotted. Each engagement also takes place in a surprisingly open arena; there are multiple paths that you can take to sneak up behind or flank your enemies, as well as set traps or just look for a way out. Throughout the many stages you'll find a variety of items that you can use to craft makeshift weapons, replenish your first aid kit supply, or upgrade your guns. And once you've gone through the game's story, you can start a New Game Plus, where you start with all of the upgrades and bonuses you had at the end of your recent playthrough, something I'm just now trying out.,,And my impression is without having tried the multiplayer mode. You know you game is d*mn good when the single player alone will almost perpetually keep you busy.,,Lastly, be sure to completely ignore most if not all of the negative user reviews. Most of what I saw compared The Last of Us to Bioshock Infinite, which is incredibly idiotic on those users' parts as these games aren't even the same genre, and most of them are likely adolescent Call of Duty fans that demand that a game hold their hand and tell them exactly what button to press for every waking moment that the game is on.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,5,4,10,train

StephenJ,"The Last of Us is the only game I've ever played where I've truly felt like one wrong misstep or one missed bullet could cost me my life. Naughty Dog truly achieved creating a perfect survival game from scavenging houses for a couple bullets to get you through the next encounter to searching frantically for wraps and alcohol to create a health kit to patch yourself up from the previous encounter. But while I could rant all day about the level of perfection that Naughty Dog achieved with the game play, I also should touch on the story. Anyone who's played Naughty Dog's previous installments of the Uncharted series knows that the developer can piece together a fantastic, weaving story that can be at times heart wrenching. Somehow, they exceeded all of the already high expectations that I had set for the story of this game. From losing loved ones to exacting revenge, this game covers every emotion known to man during a whirlwind of a 14 hour campaign that you will want to come back to. The final thing to touch on is the multi-player that I can't quite find myself capable of putting down. Each human encounter in an online match is formed not just as a fight for your life, but also a fight for the survival of your unseen clan that you are gathering food, supplies and medicine for. There is the standard perk system that everyone has come to know and love since Call of Duty and also a weapon upgrade system that makes you find a squared balance between your capabilities to sneak or fight.,,In summation, this game deserves every individual point on the 10 system scale that I've assigned to it. If you own a PlayStation 3, buy this game. If you do not own a PlayStation 3, then go to your local game shop to buy one along with a copy of this game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,8,6,10,train

That's all I can really say without giving it away but it's a yarn worth hearing.,Graphics: 10 The best graphics you will find on any console anywhere but more importantly, those graphics are put to use in all the best ways bringing alive an overgrown wasteland with stunning lighting, rich foliage, and so-real-it's-eerie character models.,Sound: 9.5 The music is appropriate and accentuates the quiet moments with soulful guitar and the loud moments with tense orchestral pieces.  The voice-acting is second to none truly giving the script the grounding it needed.  My only gripe is that sometimes sound effect will abruptly stop and start during parts of the game.,Gameplay: 9.5 Desperation is the name of the game and you never forget it.  Conserve your ammunition if you can by stealthily avoiding the games varied foes so that when it hits the fan, you can hit back.  The aiming is spotty but that just ratchets up the intensity when you've got a mob after you.  Would've liked a better way of knowing whether you were going to be spotted though.

This game's combat is extremely satisfying. From brutal melee kills, to perfectly balanced gun-play, and amazing stealth sequences, this game delivers on all fronts. My favorite part in this game was the story. It was truly a monumental tale of trying to find something to fight for in a world that's lost everything. The heart wrenching prologue even threatened to bring a tear to my eye. The entire reason that I own a PlayStation 3 is the trailer shown for this game at the 2012 VGA's. The lack of ammo and the scavenging for any little thing to help you, along with the fact that the infected aren't your biggest threat, gave me the most authentic ""zombie apocalypse"" experience of any game that came before it.

Itzille,"Naughty Dog, famous for Crash Bandicoot and Uncharted have entried new ground with The Last of Us, this is complete different compared to their other earlier games. The plot is that a type of virus have made a lot of people infected and they've turned into absurd creatures which are like zombies. There are not that many survivors and all former rules and laws have stopped existing. Every day is a fight for survival. One man that definitely knows this is the main-character Joel, he doesn't hesitate a second when comes to killing people to survive.,After not long at all in the game he meets a girl named Ellie who is very special. After that a dangerous journey begins where Joel and Ellie have to fight for their lives.,,The Last of Us has the most wonderful acting and the storytelling is nothing else than superb! Joel and Ellie.  This is what makes it one of the finest and best games within its genre. The game looks amazing too, in my opinion it has the best graphics on the Ps3.,,The gameplay is great as well. Since it's about survival you don't have that much ammo and your health is not regenerating. This makes the game really interesting since you can't just run into bunch of guys. You basically need to come up with a plan before entering the fight and make a decision whether to kill the guys/ infected with your gun or take them out silently.,,But as i've already mentioned the best about this game is the storytelling and the conversations between Joel and Ellie are so good, it almost feels like you're in the game yourself. The acting of the characters is also very realistic.,With this game Naughty Dog has shown that they're one of the best game-developers in the world and they've set a new standard for game within this genre.,,The Last of Us is the best game i've played in a long time and it's arguably the prettiest game on Ps3.

Cirrusstrafe,"To address most people's fears first, yes things are linear, but it doesn't feel that way. Why? Because everything is beautiful, every piece of broken furniture, glass, tipped car, downed pole, corroded trash can, etc feels like it was placed to make the world feel real, even in the dead ends. The places you do go don't feel like those Scooby Do cels, where the 6 coins that Shaggy will burst out of from the pile of money that fell on him are brightly colored elements on an otherwise void and dull backdrop setpiece. Everything feels real. Sure, the world is rife with 'chest high cover' but given the theme, setting, and wonderful object population it doesn't feel like Gears of War where caves just happened to slowly build up stalagmites in perfectly staggered military style cover; it's like I would go into a shop and almost want to say ""wow, this stool and this tilted vending machine and these shelves would be here and totally look like this!"",,The combat is tough and visceral, and the unique approach to stealth (batman sonar aside) in a freaking zombie game mixed with scavenging and survival aspect is done about as well as one can imagine. While the ""boss"" battle I fought seemed slightly out of place, the rest of the combat has been stellar. Stragglers, military, and zombies all require different tactics, act and react differently, and have astoundingly fierce A.I. Plus there's something of a rush when you realize you have no ""grenades"" or ammo as a mob of zombies are barreling at you and you realize your only option is to make a molotov on the fly screaming ""Oh god come on please faster jesus."",,Oh and the characters, god I could go on for hours. Suffice to say this is the best voice acting I have ever, ever heard. Combined with the absurdly detailed and  and well, you know Naughty Dog's priorities lay in making you feel like everything is truly real, and make you invested in everything that happens. Each character I have run into so far aside from one early on feels like a unique, multidimensional person that really lives in the setting the game is in, that has been through some scarring crap, and acts as I would expect. They aren't one dimensional caricatures that exist to move the plot along while Hero McBada** takes the spotlight at all times, they aren't husks of a few cobbled personality traits to act as foils or compliments to the protagonists (I don't say good guys, because this game blows away clearly defined lines of heroism in favor of real, true people). I don't feel like I'm just interacting with people just to move from A to B and get through the plot, I feel like I want to meet them all and help them or fight them and interact with them and the plot is there to simply give me a direction in which to travel this absurdly well built world. I... yeah, hours.,,I won't write a book about this one but the pacing is also wonderful (after the first hour, after the best prologue in video game history the game goes full stop and spends an hour going from 0 to 5, then ramps to 60 in about thirty minutes).,,This game is the nearest thing to a perfect single player adventure I have ever experienced, and I have played a LOT of games.,,If you own a PS3 but not this game, do yourself a favor and buy it, or at least rent it. Just do it. If you don't own a PS3, borrow one.

I've already finished the story, and the buildup and character development are prime for the end of a console generation. Before you play this game, be warned though- this is not just another Uncharted, and the heartwarming moments of the game, while very powerful, are few and far between the loss and brooding tone that the game brings about with its exceptional story telling. It is a very dark story with very dark consequences to actions and subject matter that some might find uncomfortable such as suicide in mass, the deaths of family members, and decisions between the prosperity of everybody and the good of the few. The brutality of the infected world contrasts heavily with the innocence of several younger characters in the game. All darkness of the game aside, both the story and multiplayer elements of the game are fantastic and an excellent time. The story took me about 15 hours to complete- a far cry from the world of games that are being released today with emphasis only on online and 5-hour stories. Buy this game. Shed tears.

Kasumi-G,"Despite a few minor glitches, the character development and the story within each one pulls me away that lets me accept The Last of Us into a perfect well made game. The gameplay for me was very smooth and I had no trouble at all. My slight complain would of been that I hardly found any ammo, but I figured that was just part of the survival and the hard mode. I do wish the music was more vibrant throughout the entire game, like in the ending, where you are holding Ellie and escaping. Rather than your typical good ending (save the day, everyone is cure), or your bad ending (Ellie dies, no cure), I like how Naughty Dog went super in-depth with Joel's character. We see him at the beginning loose his daughter, and we all know something like that can be seriously painful to a person. If you payed attention to the game, you'll notice Joel starts to get attached with Ellie and eventually he just doesn't want to let her go. At some point he even says he can't live without her (he paraphrased it differently). Joel knew Ellie could have done so much for humanity and the vaccine's progression would have been successful, but he lost himself with her because of his loss. His heart was broken and he wanted to replace it with something similar to his daughter's heart. I think (at least me) I would of just done the same and just carried on my life with Ellie rather than see her perish before my eyes just for some vaccine, despite lying to her and not telling her the truth about what happened. (I actually kind of felt bad there when he said ""I swear"". She deserves to know the truth, especially since she lost everyone as well, or was abandoned).,,The ending to me was rather more depressing than any other emotion, and it seriously struck me hard.

panderson1988,"First of all, this is probably one of the best games I've played in a long time. I felt like this is one of the best post apocalyptic story out there, and overall I saw strong connections to other stories like ""I am Legend"" and the first season of the ""Walking Dead."" The biggest strength is the character development between Ellie and Joel, and there is a lack of cliches that you'll see in other games and stories. The best thing is the drama between the characters feels genuine and not petty drama like the Walking Dead has become on TV.,,The other good strength is the combat as it influences survival instincts by limiting the resources you can get as ammo and knifes, therefore you usually have to resort to stealth. If you fail with your stealth, then you'll end up using most of your resources or you'll easily die. The gameplay is setup in which you have various paths to take out your enemies or try to sneak around. The only gripe I have is the enemy AI at times seems to lack logic when they are searching for you, and your companions sometimes make loud noises that don't make sense when you are sneaking around. That said, I was able to look past that as it didn't deprive the gameplay for me.,,Finally the environment is the strongest aspect of the game. There is a diverse range of environments from cities to countryside to small towns, and the map design for each areas feels unique. The art direction of the environments is outstanding, and it really feels like a post apocalyptic America with little moments that bring in the immersion such as finding letters in which you learn about random people's past.

bosconian87,"I've recently played Capcom's Remember Me, a game of which attempted to be an interactive movie, and almost succeeded, only failing slightly in the fact that although the sum of the parts was greater than the whole, the varied types and quality of gameplay and strict linearity of the game sometimes detracted from the whole experience, and left me wanting more.  With this in mind, I picked up Naughty Dog's latest game, and a move away from the worldwide globetrotting of Uncharted, but still it is kind of put forward as almost an interactive movie.  And its Uncharted that leaps to mind immediately once the breathtaking intro has gone, but give it a little time and you will realise that this is a very different beast that you are playing, and for that matter, one heck of a ride too!!  First-up I have to comment on the presentation of the game  its really hard for me to say this, but if you pay close enough attention to the graphics and sound, you will quickly realise that this is far, far above anything that Uncharted dazzled with.  The graphics are outright beautiful, mixing the dour, deconstructed enviroments with a lighting engine that simply shines (no pun intended), but the real star is the acting and the characters in the game  simply beautiful.  The cut-scenes use the in-game engine as well, which is evidence enough of how good they are.  The sound is used more for background effect (other than the sublime voice-acting obviously) but it ties in a feel to the whole game of a John Carpenter movie, at times almost a western  an unexpected risk, but a welcome one.  I must say lastly, the sound effects are amazing  I've never been so utterly petrified by a clicking sound, and how it moves closer, so this must be a first!!  And now to the gameplay  thankfully, Naughty Dog knew what they were doing when they cut the gameplay styles down, in order to (a)maintain a due sense of tension that at times hits the roof, and (b)allows them to apply some amazing twists to said gameplay, and (c)stick to the plot, and the central characters, without taking the player unnecessarily out of that plot, and ruin the whole experience, by relying on a cheap gag.  And speaking of those characters, the whole thing gels amazingly because everything has been invested in  this if anything, feels like the game that Remember Me was trying to be: a superb storyline, well-written characters and script, locations that provide a breathaking spin on an old premise (the apocalypse), and gameplay that simply doesn't tire.  As many critics have written, is The Last of Us the best game ever created?  No, I don't think  so  its one of the best of this current generation certainly.  But if you like me have had enough of promises from the next-generation of consoles that are soon to be coming out, and simply want to be blown-away right now you should pick this up.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,5,3,10,test

And the pacing is perfected I think.,,The gameplay is some of the best third person action I have played, the sneaking is great and better than some games that focus on stealth, but the action is just brutal and so exhilarating. There is not that many games that makes the blood pump with excitement like this game. The graphics are amazing for PS3, some of the characters looks better than anything I have seen, even games on PC which have generally better graphics, can't compare to the amazing detail on some of the characters in this game.,I wish it was released on PC, as some higher res and AA would have made this game one of the best looking games ever, but still it looks more than good enough.,,The game is long to, which is great as I spent a bit over 15 hours to finish the game, and I did not wish it to end at all, so I really hope there will be some sequels for this series.,,Naughty Dog is one of the reasons why you would buy a PS3, and I truly hope that a sequel to this game comes out to the PS4. If they can make something this great for PS3, then I can't even imagine what they have in store for the PS4. This is the best game for a console yet, and that says a lot.,,If you own a PS3 and never play this, you don't deserve to own a PS3 as it is the best way to end the current generation of consoles.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,7,4,10,train

The Game looks stunning, the atmosphere gives you chills at times and the game as a whole is nearly perfect. It reminded me a lot of Walking Dead and other Survival/Zombie Movies and the story was really interesting and was a perfect fit. The animations and soundeffects are top notch, i cant recall a game with better animations. The Crafting system is interesting, you constantly search for loot and this is finally a game where you really have to make every bullet count. There were a couple of times where i had 5 shots left and had to manage somehow. This added to the tension a lot and made it even better. There is so much small stuff to explore, the world feels real and believable. I seriously can´t point out a single bit i didn´t like, this is the best game of this console generation. Seriously play this game! Even the length was good. It took me 12.30 hours to finish it, but i didn´t find every hidden detail. I will replay the game for sure and get everything next time.

Pickle,"There isn't a game that can be called ""perfect"", however there are games where the pros are so many and are so perfectly executed that there is no way a couple of flaws in the game are going to affect your entire experience while playing it.,The Last of Us is one of those games where even if the game has his fare share of flaws they never seemed to affect the entire experience.,The good things about the game are well... pretty much everything that you would consider to make an amazing modern game, everything is in there, the voice acting is incredible, the graphics and visuals are stunning.,Meanwhile i was playing i couldn't avoid to just stop for a minute to look at every inch of detail that is being put on to the graphics, is just stunningly beautiful to just see how much effort was put into this specific department.,Aside from that, the gameplay is just excellent.,To me playing the last of us was an amazing experience, that not that many games out there makes me have for so long as the last of us has had me experiencing, the crafting system is clean, fast, easy, and rewarding, whenever i felt like i was in a foxhole because a hunter was coming straight at me, i just went and checked what i could craft that might kill him or at least distract him long enough for me to make my next move, and the end result was just him going up into flames caused by the just crafted molotov that i threw to him.,The story is the huge thing about ""The Last of Us"" is just one of those stories that keep getting much more complex and at the same time much more interesting while you keep playing it through, without getting to a point where it becomes tedious or annoyingly complex like some other amazing games might happen to have.,Every character is just extremely likable, even the ones that want you to feel mildly disgusted by them they just seem to have such an appreciation that comes from the player just on how well done they are for you to feel that way about them.,This being made by the excellent voice acting the top notch animations both in cutscenes and in gameplay and of course the stunning visuals that are the most noticeable aspect of the game by many.,So the story is excellent, the graphics are gorgeous, and the gameplay is fun and entertaining, well, how about the audio, the voice acting and the animations?,Im pleased to say that each and every single one of those departments delivers such an awesome and dedicated job just as the others.,The voice acting is amazing one of the best i've ever heard in any video game, is just flawless in most of the different situations that you hear it.,You can tell when they're scared and shocked by something, even if in some cases it my recycle, like when you bash someones skull with a pipe and then you take cover, Ellie would say ""holy s**t Joel!"" and then you just go and shoot someone in the head and she would say the line again. But it's never something that breaks you out of the experience although is something obviously noticeable.,The animations are are the most incredible animations that i've ever seen in a game in my life, and i've played pretty much 90% of games that have come out since the snes, is just flawless when i saw Joel's mouth cringe and his general facial expression showing a sign of struggle coming from a hunter trying to slit his throat with a glass shard, it just adds so much to the experience seeing the animations of this game perform flawlessly in combat or in different small chats that Joel and Ellie might have from time to time.,,In conclusion i think ""The Last of Us"" is the best game for the ps3 and one of the best games that i've ever played is just impressive how Naughty Dog just used every single tool from modern technology and managed to deliver an incredible experience that is gruesome, heartbreaking, and extremely violent in every single way possible, and at the same time just leave you with your stomach tight, your head still and your jaw dropped from playing such a masterpiece.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,22,12,10,test

Morlar,"I didnt have any hype actually for this game until the review's started coming out with all the tens. I quickly later understood that this game would be amazing. Now back to my review, I've never experienced a better intro, just such a brilliant intro. The voice acting is phenomenal and just feels so natural and every character had such an fantastic script, I couldn't almost wait for the next cutscene which also were beautifully made. I haven't been a super fan of Uncharted but I loved the gameplay in The Last of Us, I never had any problems with the stealth parts and the firearms worked very good with the design, the feeling and the sound. I think that it was a good thing to make the allies invincible to the targets but sometimes they could get in the way and pull you out of the game sometimes, but it wasn't any gamebreaking things or over all annoying. The customization was good but it would be nice with something yet more deep. The story was so immersive and fantastic that it will be a experience that will never leave me. I'm not gonna talk to much about the multiplayer but I will say that it's as everything else, fantastic. I expected something decent but what I got was one of the funniest mulitplayer I've played for a long time, this coming from a high end spec pc gamer. Since I'm also a pc gamer I got to talk about the graphics, they literally are MIND blowing for the PS3, I sometimes just stopped playing and just started looking at the graphics. This game could be my favorite game of ALL time and I've played games for a long time. Hats of to Naught dog for making this amazing game.

MooreReviews,"I have been a fan of Naughty Dog's games ever since Jak and Daxter came out for the PS2 back in 2001. This made my expectations very high for The Last of Us, and I have to say it did not let me down. The game is near perfect on almost every level. The graphics are the best the PS3 has to offer; Or any current GEN console as a matter of fact. The gameplay is solid and gritty and keeps you on the edge of the seat the whole time. The first 15 minutes of The Last of Us are so engaging and make you emotionally attached to characters within a matter of minutes. Throughout The Last of Us you will be fighting two types of Enemies humans and infected with your AI companion Ellie. Ellie is not your typical AI getting in your way while trying to fight enemies. She is a character that you grow to care for and provides help in battles. The Last of Us is graphically stunning and in some moments will have me stop and stare at my surrounding environments. The story takes you to several environments and will make it hard to put the controller down. The story is divided by seasons and each section changes and adds new aspects to the game. The only thing bad I have to say about this game is that sometimes AI will run around a clicker and not get noticed, but if I crawl slowly around it'll get me killed. This in no way ruins the game, it is still an amazing experience. Anyone who gives this game a negative review is a Microsoft fan boy that is mad because the Xbox One got overshadowed by the PS4. While this game is not for everyone because of it strong violence it's still can be appreciated because of it's fantastic story telling and graphics that make the game so immersive. If you have even thought about picking up The Last of Us, go do it now!

GFC,"Before I start this review  I will just say I haven't come close to beating this game yet. I have made it to around when you meet Bill for the first time. Well anyways the story so far. It starts off as you playing as Joel's daughter. She woke up from a phone call then went off to find her dad. After an explosion her dad comes in the house. That is where you encounter your first zombie. You get a vehicle with Tommy? He wasn't in the game to much so far so sorry if I got the name wrong. After some retards getting in your way Joel""s daughter gets shot starting off the game From that moment on you know this will be a very sad story. 20 years later Joel is in a little apartment were a girl who seems to be friends with Joel shows up. I forgot her name as well so lets call her Plot Point. The two of them want to kill some guy who stole their guns. After some serious ass kicking Joel and Plot Point find out he sold the guns to the Fireflies. Then out of nowhere the leader of the fireflies shows up. She tells the they have to smuggle something to get their guns back. It turns out the thing they are smuggling is a girl named Ellie. So then Joel and Plot point take Ellie and they proceed to smuggle her. After some luck it turns put Ellie was bitten three weeks ago. When bitten it takes up to 2 days to turn. So Ellie explains to them she might be the cure. After going to the main Firefly place it turns out they just left. that is where it turns out Plot Point was bitten. She wasn't in the game very much and didn't have much character progession so I wasn't sad from her death. I feel like most other characters aren't developed enough so I wonder why even bring them in? After that the plot just kind of goes on.,,As for the gameplay it is pure survival horror. There are three enemy types. Infected, Clickers and people. All these enemies feel natural because none of them are overpowered. Humans because they think logically and its easy to shoot them. Infected because they are stupid. And then there are clickers who are interesting. If I clicker gets to you, you are dead. But their downfall is they are blind and they see through sounds much like bats. When ever there is an enemy I feel a rush, Also this game is very stealth based. Since it stays true to survival horror ammo is rare. There are many ways to kill your enemies and I like that.,,Some finishing thoughts:,,This game looks FANTASTIC! I have never seen a game more beautiful. Also the voice acting is great. It brings the characters to life.,,I was going to give this game and 8 from silly things in the story and from under developed characters but Joel and Ellie easily gives this game a 9/10,,-GFC",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,9,5,9,train

After completing the game, and looking back at everything that took place, I kind of understand not only the main characters but the actions taken by everyone in the game.

ColdHardTruth,"Last Of Us is an action oriented 3rd person shooter with some survival moments. The story is what makes this game epic! The story is deep and captivating and you'll love the main characters. Fighting to survive in a world of doom is something a lot of developers are doing nowadays. Naughty Dog found the middle road between a great story and entertaining game play. The story takes place at the beginning of the outbreak and takes you across the country meeting new NPC's and discovering new areas. Spectacular graphics and great voice acting also help tell this epic story (one of the best cinematics up to now). Notable game play elements are, the shooting mechanics and cover system are one of the best I've seen to date (smooth and responsive). Crafting ability is simple to understand and use. You can also upgrade your characters skills and weapons. For me the most disappointing thing was there just was too much combat as I was expecting less. In combat situations Naughty Dog does give you the option to either do stealth or guns a blazing if you prefer. For casual gamers I recommend to put this game on easy setting so you can enjoy the story with less frustration at certain times. At the end I was greatly satisfied with The Last OF Us and I do recommend buying this one.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,8,4,9,test

Wedgybaby,"Having been affected by the AutoSave glitch I started off pretty much hating this game... Having to replay 7 hours on the trot makes a guy really pick out the things he dislikes about a game: camera is too close to Joal when sneaking, slightly heavy controls and cumbersome movement, too much repetition (go here fight these guys, go here fight these guys), the recycled soundtrack used over and over in different tones...,,However, once I caught up with my original play through I started warming to it again. I am seeing a lot of 10/10 scores for this game which leads me to suspect that professional games reviewers are a bit like sheep, with no-one daring to buck the trend... and whilst I don't think its a 10/10 game it is certainly VERY GOOD. The voice acting and animation are second to none and the visuals are very impressive. The sound effects are fitting and the music does occasionally change to a different track once in a while... I think the crafting system could have been much deeper and also the skills that you level up make little to no difference on the easier modes, so that could have done with tweaking...,,I recently reviewed remember me on the Xbox... to me this game feels a lot like that did in the sense that something great was made but a masterpiece was possible. I love everything they did with the direction of this game... I just wanted even more (hunting for food, more craftable items, a deeper skill system...).,,A must play game of this generation.

vinone,"The Last of Us is an above average game, but no where near perfect.  The world and characters are simply amazing and watching the story play out is one of the better experiences in video games.  The game it's self is nothing more than above average.  The graphics look great, character animations and interactions with the environment and each other are great to watch, but there are some definite issues with objects popping into and out of environments, including an entire building that I was in at one point, and a strange shimmer and glow to a lot of objects in the environment.  The Uncharted-esque  style of game play is translated fairly well, but does take some time to get used to.  The gun play and stealth are again, above average, but do leave a little bit to be desired.  There are collectibles hidden everywhere, and if you're into trophies you'll definitely have to play the game numerous times.  Overall, I can't deny the enjoyment I got from this game, I beat the entire story in two sittings, including powering through the last 8 hours in one sitting.  The story, world, and characters and simply amazing to watch, but with some strange graphical glitches, and some game play mechanics that just seem a little off on occasion, The Last of Us is an great game with some basic issues that are pretty easy to overlook, and should make you happy to be a gamer in 2013.",normal,ps3,2013-06-16,English,13,4,8,train

It becomes really irritating when you have to redo the same part 10 times over because the sometimes clunky aiming controls with melee weapons in small rooms can cause a bit of trouble when dealing with those Clickers, or that you can't get your health up (or have no ability to craft health packs) at the very moment.,,This is a bit of nitwitting and I know ND had to cut out some stuff somewhere, but at some parts the textures are really bad, I've seen some very low quality metal and glass alike textures and at several moments in the game I've seen clipping issues where the entire world started flickering or disappearing taking away from the immersion, at some points I could then even see through walls and what not. Near the end of the game I even ran into some NPC's that managed to catch me and I got to see a short cutscene of how they killed me, but in that cutscene I didn't see any environment at all, just the characters on a bluescreen background...,,For me this game has no replay value at all, I was really pissed off when I figured out after playing the first 4 hours that it couldn't save my game...

The motion capture, subtle emotion, and voice work are all top notch and the best I've ever seen/heard. Also, the vastness of space combined with the amount of detail in this game is jaw dropping. At times, I was so immersed I forgot I was watching a video game and felt like I was watching real people trek through a journey of survival. I think the overall gameplay experience will be a love it or hate it. Like some games that focus solely on action combat, this game focuses solely on survival combat. Theres not a lot of variety between core gameplay mechanics. Its always either stealth, survival combat, or environmental traversal. So if you love those mechanics, you'll love this game, but if you wish for something more, this game may not satisfy you completely. Also, this is not really a horror game, its a survival game. It not scary in the sense that when you see a monster you are horrified by its look and sound, its horrifying in the sense of hopelessness the present world evokes. Its horrifying to see how people now interact with each other because of this hopelessness in the world. The reason I didn't give the game a 10 was the survival of the main characters at times seemed so far fetched and forced to keep the story going. While I know this is just a ""game"" and pretty much every game does this, I think it stood out more in this game because everything else was so much more immersive.

It's a 'Zombie Apocalypse' style game, which makes the plot pretty predictable.  The 'stealth' system is pretty easy to abuse for gamers accustomed to the genre, and the non player characters don't seem to attract the attention of the Infected despite standing up and running within sneezing distance of the enemies to get to the player controlled character who is trying to sneak around (which can really ruin the mood).

Combat gets old quickly all baddies are crack shots while you will waste bullets trying to hit them as run straight at you. Enemies armed with guns will not drop their ammo for some reason even if they didn't fire a shot.,,The story is obvious from the start. The intro mentions the Fireflies a group of rebels being hounded by the military. As soon as that was said I knew I would be forced to join/help them.  This bothered me the most the game is about survival. Joel makes it obvious he wants to live so  agreeing to help a terrorist  organization who is being slaughtered as you speak to their leader who suffering from a gunshot to the gut  doesn't seem like it will have a good outcome.,,You end up helping the Fireflies by smuggling Ellie out of the zone. At some point you are caught by soldiers who check for infection. You kill them and realize Ellie is infected but is somehow immune and the Fireflies want to create a cure. This is by far one of the most overused tropes in my opinion. I would have been more impressed if it turned out Ellie was the origin of the virus or something.,,Then you have Tess who is doomed from the start. Trailers made a big deal about Joel and Ellie surviving together so I knew she had a time limit on her.,,As for the multiplayer its fun but nothing special. I liked the customized character even though you don't play as your character.  You pick what hat, mask, and helmet you wear then when the match starts you'll be randomly a male or female of a different race.,,All in all the game is good fun. Does it deserve all the 10's? No. Does it deserve 0's? No. Its an above average game that you will enjoy.,,Also if you haven't played the game don't write a review with a 10 saying how good the game is.

Ironsheik,"Story: 6/10,Decent twists, good story overall, yet at the same time extremely reminicscene of any other zombie outbreak game I've played before. Virus breaks out, people die, post-apocalyptic era. A cure arises, you spend the game trying to deliver the cure (Ellie) to researchers, but a bond develops and you sacrifice the sake of human kind over your emotions,,Characters: 8/10,You'll fall in love with the characters Your main character is a stoic who doesn't talk about the past yet you can tell has a heart of gold and takes time warming up to anyone and in the end just misses his daughter Ellie: Awesome at first, a 14 year old cool as hell girl who yearns for the affection of anyone who will have her and care about her The supporting characters never last long but all have their own attitudes and demeanor that make them all memorable,,AI: 5/10,Falls extremely short here. I didn't play the hardest mode, but in hardmode the game was a cakewalk provided you didn't run headfirst into everything. The human enemies seemed to ignore their comrades dying right in front of them, and every infected in the game could be avoided with a simple brick/bottle Enemies could also be avoided when spotted by simply running away and hiding for 5 seconds,,Gameplay: 5/10,,The upgrade system is flawed, and gives you seemingly useless upgrades for certain weapons (Increased fire rate on a one shot pistol anyone?). Smoke bombs were also beyond useless in the game The firefight system was no different from any uncharted game, but at the same time Uncharted system isn't bad by any means, but does get redundant.,,The game followed a simple pattern, Story Stockup Human Area Infected Area,,Was very predictable as what was going to happen, you would spend a half hour searching every place for materials/ammo to be greeted with a all too predictable firefight The game itself was extremely linear, you could either spend ten minutes in an area and stockup on a few bullets, or simply rush to the exit, there was no diverging or backtracking by any means The puzzles were almost non existent, not to say it was supposed to be a puzzle game, but was too easy to spot.,,Water area? Find a pallet,,No doors? Find a ladder or dumpster to climb on,,Locked door? Find a hole Ellie can crawl through,Yawn.,,Also the hardest difficulty is not unlocked at the start, why do games do this? Hard difficulty is a bore, but the Survivor (Hardest) difficulty is tolerable, as you lose the ability to see through walls to spot enemies, which is a core component in earlier difficulties, but since the game as little replayability there is little motivation to play again on survivor,,Graphics: 8/10,,No complaints, good, decent animations, minor screen tearing to warrant 8,,Replayability: 1/10,,Hardest difficult isn't available from the start, and since this game is mainly story driven, there is little motivation. You get to unlock skins, big whoop. No new areas, no new enemies, you only get to keep upgrades, which make an easy game even easier. Only motivation is trophies, which are for nerds anyway.,,Sound: 6/10,,Nothing spectacular as far as soundtrack goes, it has its soppy music for the soppy scenes, but no new great sound effects, but does do pretty good with the infected,,Dialogue: 7/10,,Awesome dialogue, at first Ellie is awesome with her cursing the world, but soon gets repetitive and monotonous and just plain annoying. The game also features hidden dialogue that is optional depending on whether or not you pay attention to the surrounding characters during scenes, some of which can be very heart-felt.,,Consensus: Another great Naughty dog game for PS3 with great graphics characters and story, but the same gameplay as others we've seen. If you've play uncharted you've played this, certainly doesn't live up to hype of all the 10/10 you've seen a million times. Virtually no replayability and all of the trophies are inspired by collectathons.

There IS the occasional glitch (as with most games), but the only thing that really takes me out of the experience is when Ellie will run out in front of the enemies and they will not see her at all!

One of the most engaging experiences I've ever played. (and I've been gaming since around the age of 3 back in '83!) The combat is underpowered in comparison to other games, but I LOVE that. It really gives a sense of fear and dread as you move along in the game. It really emphasizes the need for stealth. I would recommend this game to almost anyone, except for those who just absolutely loathe stealth games. Even then, you should give it a shot at least for the story and acting.

The character depth is unparalleled... the voice acting is full of emotion. It just works. And then there's the visuals.

ExistentialEnso,"The hype leading up to my chance to play The Last of Us had me worried, as it seemed like I would be disappointed because I thought no game could live up to the expectations I had for it. I was wrong. Naughty Dog has succeeded in crafting what is undoubtedly one of the absolute best games of all time, an emotional tour de force that, while set in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-in-all-but-name-only-infested world, spends a lot of time exploring the humanity of enduring such an environment.,,Some reviews have criticized the actual gameplay, but I love it. The game rewards players who can think creatively and act stealthily over those who can shoot the enemies dead the fastest. By other metrics, the game makes no compromises: for a game running on almost 7-year-old hardware, the graphics are stunning, with the writing, voice acting, art direction, soundtrack, and level design all among the absolute best in the video game world.,,The game has kept me greatly on edge and had me in tears less than an hour into the game. It has kept me in awe of both the ugliness of many of the areas ravaged by the events of the game and the sheer beauty of those that nature has reclaimed in the absence of meddling from humanity, infected or not.,,Games like this and Bioshock Infinite make me optimistic about the future of gaming. The Last of Us is a true masterpiece, ranking among not only among my absolute favorite video games of all time, but among my favorite entries in any art/entertainment medium. It's often gritty and heavy, but it greatly rewards those who enjoy deep, sometimes tragic, character-driven storytelling: the same strategy that networks like HBO and AMC seem to be focusing on with their original content in recent years to much success.,,All in all, if the idea of a post-apocalyptic survival game doesn't completely turn you off, you owe it to yourself to play this game.",normal,ps3,2013-06-15,English,40,25,10,train

DragonKingSoup,"The Last of Us has been a long time coming, and the wait is finally over, the question is does this game live up to the hype and the Metacritic user reviews?  The answer is yes and it seems that Sony has saved the best of it's exclusives for last.,,Story:,To not go over what has been said before in reviews before me, I will start by saying that the opening  ten minutes of this game explain so much with so little.  Naughty Dog has went to great lengths to make sure characters we play as and pull for have deep narratives that compels the player to continue forward.  The setting is very much out of the book, ""The Road"" but with a twist.  The use of infection as a fungus that creates fast zombies and as I have dubbed them with my roommate, ""Bat Raptors"".  We ended up playing for about three hours before we knew it, which is a testament to the games pacing and narrative.,,Gameplay:,The idea of this game is basically Uncharted meets survival horror and it pulls this off extremely well.  From someone who was played survival horror since it's inception, no other game since Resident Evil 4 and at for what I have played of Amnesia, has me had be panic under pressure.  This is the key point of the entire game and regardless of how well you prepare for the next encounter, most first time players will barely scrap through each wave of attacks.  The basic stealth mechanic is maybe the highlight to this terror was it is the most effective and painless way to get through a combat issue, but since the AI seems to hug you at all times, combat quickly turns to oh no, oh god quick find cover, where the hell did Ellie go?!  Since you don't have regenerative health like in most games, you have to add that to the list of things to juggle when in combat, along with having a extremely finite amount of ammunition and supplies. Players quickly find that bricks and bottles can be thrown at enemies to distract and stun which allows for brutal hand to hand combat which becomes the weapon of choice when all other methods have been exhausted.  The real time crafting system adds to this mayhem, it can be both a life saving move or a costly mistake when used mid-combat.  The game also rewards players for fully exploring the environment as players will find equipment, bullets, collectable items, vitamins for upgrading Joel himself and scrap metal to upgrade the equipment Joel has.  The game does have shortcomings, the AI seems to be invisible when sneaking or always getting caught and at times and I have found a few cheap deaths that are due to bugs.  The overall package however is one worth replaying a least one time to max out all the equipment as the game boosts a new game plus and a survivor mode for those how have nerves of steel.,,Visuals:,The game may not be as visually up to par after looking at what is to come this holiday season or even the recent visuals of Metro: Last Light on PC. Once again however, the artwork of the landscapes and maddening attention to detail makes the world come alive.  The destroyed Boston which players will first encounter, drops them from the tense and depressing opening to a near hopeless setting of 2033 America.  (wink wink to Metro 2033 yet again).  Nature is taking back a country that is run by the American military and opposed by the Fireflies who wish to bring back a system of government.  What final graphic push that could be brought out of the aging PS3 was done to only compliment a excellent story and setting which immerses the player into the game, a extremely difficult  visual feat .,,Verdict:,The Last of Us is not just a great game, it transcends that of what a game should be, it takes what other games have done and refines and uses them to create a unique experience.  The best parts of this game are those when you as the player are being forced to play combat by ear and pray that your last supplies will solve the problem.  Not all the parts of this game are perfect, they could have used some work, but when your story, atmosphere, combat and characters are this good, you can over look some issues.,,Metacritic only allows a 9  or a 10 but honesty this game is a 9.5 or A.",normal,ps3,2013-06-15,English,5,3,10,train

From the beautiful overgrown cities and the dark corridors and amazing character models this game looks stunning. The games length is surprising I finished my walkthrough in 10hrs 35mins which is good I normally complete games quickly and can still see and do everything I completed Bioshock infinte in 7hrs 40mins to give you a rough idea, I thought it was going to be shorter just because of the past games Naughty Dog has delivered like Uncharted. From start to finish it really does not disappoint so it was a nice surprise that the story keeps on going. The cast of characters are nicely varied, brining in there own experiences and problems along the way with superb voice acting through out. The sound throughout this game is superb its suttle but only comes in when needed you will spend most of your time listening to birds, wind, tree branches crackle and the sound of Ellie whistling but its to create a atmosphere that works in every situation but I recommend playing with headphones. No matter what difficulty you play on you will find yourself fearing for your life and scavenging the environment for pick ups, it makes exploration in The Last of Us more entertaining, strategic and more of a realistic approach. The stealth and combat are of a more brutal and realistic nature making fighting an enemy all more worth while it really does make you fight for your life.The AI is smart and will flank and will go to your last known position if moved, the only criticism i had was that some of the AI just stand and look at nothing but it takes nothing out of the experience. Animation in this game is the best I have ever seen from the faces to ducking behind cover and shielding Ellie its makes conveying an emotion in this game so clear. No matter what type of gamer you are sport, shooter or platformer you will love The Last of Us this is Naughty Dog at its peak and for people that are giving the game below a 9 don't listen to them because Naughty Dog should really be applauded at the masterpiece this legendary games company has made.

Jdude1006,"The Last of Us is a masterpiece. The story is heartwarming and the characters are incredible. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson are amazing in The Last of Us. The gameplay gives you some amazing AI with intense combat, cool crafting elements and freedom, most areas let you explore to (in most cases) a great extend which will help make the game last longer (which I clocked in 14+ hours on my first run on hard). The graphics and environments are beautiful and just a sight to look at (and that's not even considering how old the hardware is). The metal system from Uncharted 1 and 2 have returned in the form of 'tags' which extend your replay value as well as many collectibles and hard trophies. You also have the 'survivor' difficulty to handle and lots of cool goodies to play with (like a Jak & Daxter T-shirt for Ellie). There was one point near the end of the game that showed just how powerful the story is that just really touched me so deeply, it was that moment I said I don't care about the minor glitches with the AI, I' am giving this game a 10 out of 10... My first 10/10 (with me giving Uncharted 2 a 9.9)! I have not yet played the multiplayer of the game, but regardless of how good or bad it could be, The Last of Us is the one video game you must absolutely play in your lifetime.,,10/10",normal,ps3,2013-06-15,English,11,5,10,train

karmasleeper,"Pros:  Excellent graphics for the nearly eight year old PS3 with consistently smooth frame rates and animations.  The level design is not very complex, but the attention to detail is astounding.  I never felt like I was visiting the same place twice.  Areas are also designed in such a way that multiple paths or styles of play are possible for completing them.  Great story, believable and memorable characters.  Superb voice acting.  The crafting system is not revolutionary but, because multiple items require the same materials, forces you to make tough decisions regarding what you think you will need and what kind of play style you're going for. For example, molotovs and med packs use the same supplies, so you're forced to balance increased offense with survival.  Also, because crafting takes place in real time and because you can only carry a limited amount of equipment, you can't simply pause the game to craft a bomb and then throw it at your foes.  Combat and stealth are really tense and every shot counts.  You absolutely cannot run and gun this game.,,Cons:  Sometimes you have to figure out how to traverse certain areas in the game, a bit of light puzzle solving.  But all of this boils down to searching an area for a ladder or plank and becomes pretty transparent after the first few times.  Character movements and animations can sometimes get a bit clippy.  When in melee combat a number of times, attacks would not connect when enemy NPCs were in certain animations.  Additionally, my melee attacks also pushed NPCs into terrain or objects making me unable to hit them, but they were still able to attack me.  I was forced to back up a bit and leave myself open to other attacks just so the NPC I was attacking would get itself unstuck. The stealth segments are great, but tend to break the immersion when you have Ellie or other friendly NPCs following you.  Certain zombies in the game use sonar and are attracted to loud noises.  You have to crouch and move very carefully, but the NPCs following you will often sprint short distances when these zombies are only a few yards away and no enemies are alerted.  When sneaking around human NPCs, those following you will sometimes expose themselves trying to keep up with you but again not get detected by the enemy NPCs.  I admit the game would be unnecessarily difficult if goofy AI quirks broke your stealth, but once you figure this out, stealth segments are far less challenging than they first appear.,,The multiplayer at first glance appears tacked on, but the real time crafting is a major component of the gameplay.  Sneaking around with your team, scavenging materials, and crafting equipment to use against your enemies is ridiculously rewarding.  The multiplayer levels are well designed, too.,,Even though I've never been a fan of the Uncharted games, I find The Last of Us way more enjoyable.  The characters are more believable, the story is more engaging, and while the gameplay in some ways has less to offer, the real time crafting, tension, and pace of combat are way more impactful than what Uncharted offered.",normal,ps3,2013-06-15,English,14,8,9,test
Giffmoney,"What a game. From the visuals and voice acting, to the tight and high stakes combat system this game has it all. My only complaint is the slow character progression in the first play through. Resources are scarce and scavenging consumes an appropriate amount of time while maintaining the flow of the game. Nothing like walking into a room full of clickers with one shiv and two bullets. I am thoroughly enjoying The Last of Us and recommend it to anyone curious about the Naughty Dog Apocalypse.",normal,ps3,2013-06-15,English,16,9,9,train
Chaeote,"After a ridiculously long download time that set me back by an entire day, I finally played the game, and I'm at 46% completion (according to my save file).,,I really like it, the slow movement actually works well with the pacing and seem very realistic. the characters are great, and the environments make sense.,,It's has some very classic survival horror elements (dark, claustrophobic areas, enemies that respond to different things (some sight, some sound). It works very well.,,As for the downsides, they're mostly minor, I wish there was a wider array of melee options, large melee weapons are either 2x4's, baseball bats, or pipes, though you can attach blades to them later for a single use instant-kill).,,The small melee weapons, are either bottles, or bricks... which might be my biggest gripe... why can't I use a big rock? or hell, I can use bat, why not the baseball? Hit someone in the face with a baseball, and you can do some serious damage...,,The only bug I've come across was one time during a tough fight, The enemy got hung up on a railing that was below me, but still within striking distance, it basically allowed him to punch me to death, while I was unable to hit back or break loose, but that only happened the once.',,Overall, a GREAT game",normal,ps3,2013-06-15,English,10,5,9,train
Aeroplane33,"Start this game on Hard mode. It's the right amount of difficulty to make the game enjoyable. This review comes from the perspective of someone who paid no attention to hype. I have to say that it's fun and immersive. I was afraid of cheesiness from the acting and script but i find the story to be good and the characters to be likable. I admire the pacing. Although it is kind of sequential ie. battle..traverse the land..encounter next battle etc. The game manages to keep the experience fresh throughout by putting you in different situations that are tense and challenging. I have died a lot and have had to take a breath to re-think my way through certain areas. The rules are inflexible throughout and it's hard to cut corners in battle. The rules are simple but deep enough to make it fun all around. I admire the way it stays fresh when applying this rule-set to the different curveballs these situations throw at you. Combat is generally simple, but it's how the game feels when executing your commands that give these mechanics weight. Punching is pressing the square button, but if you punch a dude too early, or from the wrong angle or distance, he can catch you slipping and it's painful to get punished! The animations are dynamic and realistic. The physics make it so all of the damage taken or given is intense and satisfying. There is always a weight to the execution of your actions.  Aiming and reloading is tense because the reticle isn't steady and reloading takes time. Here's a tip: Always try to aim, keep the thumb on that left stick and maneuver it the whole time the enemy is in your sights. Also If you're reloading you can still run using the L2 button. The game is brutal in a fitting manner. There is a lot of creativity at work to the tiniest details. The way things react when you blast them with a shotgun, or punching an enemy in the face 4 times hard and they knock over and die! Even the way it feels when a dude whacks you with a lead pipe and you collapse to the floor and die. A lot of ""oooohhh daamn!"" type of comments coming through our mouths. Too many other details to write about!  Everything is cohesive in this world. The different enemy types are no push-overs aside from the start of the game when the AI isn't as clever. After you warm up to to the mechanics, the game will no longer hold your hand. The game is as fun to watch as it is to play. If you have a group of buddies, take turns and have some beers. You'll cheer each other on trying to get through the difficult parts. My friends and i have been yelling and laughing and having a really good time with this game! Definitely play it if you can! I give this a 9.7. I really dont know what could be improved mechanically but there are some graphical glitches here and there. No biggie. I feel like a can keep writing but I'll stop here.

Arrahant,"A gripping story about human survival and the re-ignition of love in a bittered heart. The voice acting is perfect, facial animations are top notch and the protagonist becomes a very 'real' person as the story progresses. The graphics are pretty much the best current consoles can offer. The art direction can best be described as 'dreary', perfect for a post-apocalyptic setting. I also love the sound design and the minimalistic sound track producing melancholic instrumental music that really gets you in the right mood. The story is thrust forward using ingame dialog sections, cutscenes and various items you find (such as pamphlets and notes). Overall, the fiction feels very 'real'. Thrillingly able to suspend my disbelief with a mature story.,,Gameplay:,,The game can be best described as a third person action adventure with lots of stealth elements, and a bit more exploration than you would expect from the creators of Uncharted. The game has a wonderful pace (absolutely not run and gun) and great stealth sections that will have you at the edge of your seat. The stealth reminds me a bit of Manhunt, in which rooms are like puzzles and it is for the gamer to find out efficient ways to get through the rooms. As in Manhunt, taking down enemies feels hefty and combat is raw and visceral. There is also a crafting system in place, in which you use recourses scattered throughout the levels to craft items like health packs and shivs. However, resources are scarce and some items use the same components. So you need to choose: do I want a health pack, or a molotov?,,The only downside to the game I found is the fact that sometimes your companions behave unrealistically during stealth sections, wanting to follow you around and obviously showing themselves while doing so. But it doesn't detract from the experience and luckily no alarms are triggered when it happens. Overall the companion AI is good; it is hard to make companions behave perfectly in stealth gameplay (how many games even try it?).,,Lastly, I recommend turning off all tips in the options menu so the game doesn't tell you what to do all the time, yet I found the normal difficulty setting challenging enough. Take your time with this one, try to find the hidden resources and be absorbed in the fiction. Uncharted 3 really was more of the same and a bit boring, this is refreshing and gripping. Like Red Dead Redemption and Mass Effect 2, this was a game that just did not bore me. 10/10 for the single player.",normal,ps3,2013-06-14,English,66,44,10,test

Death_Shadow,"Developer Naughty Dog has added ""The Last of Us"" to its pristine resume, which has become one of the more prestigious in all of video games. The PlayStation 3 game, which arrives in stores Friday, tells the heartfelt story of Joel and Ellie trying to survive in a world filled with death and woe. It's 20 years in the future, and the human race has been overrun by a parasitic infection that turns people into zombie-like husks that hunt other humans. There is no cure, and the goal for the few remaining humans is to survive.,,Joel is an experienced smuggler, an occupation that is strictly forbidden by his quarantine zone's military rule. He is employed by the Fireflies, an organization that fights against the military, to smuggle Ellie across the country. Joel isn't interested in what the Fireflies want with Ellie until details come to light that make this job the most important he's ever taken. The story of ""The Last of Us"" follows these central characters for a year, as their bond grows during their cross-country journey. This opens opportunities to not only explore the depth of these characters, but also show off post-apocalyptic versions of American locales. The trek begins in Boston and lands in Colorado and Salt Lake City, as well as a lengthy stay in Pittsburgh.,,Recognizable Steel City landmarks include the U.S. Steel Tower and the BNY Mellon Center Downtown, along with nods to the Strip District and Fort Pitt Bridge, but the breathtaking art is just background for the human elements on display.,,Joel and Ellie's storylines change throughout the game's 13- to 15-hour tenure. In a world overrun with horrific zombie-like creatures, the focus is almost always on the humans. The characters  not the infected  drive the plot. Much like ""The Walking Dead"" game and television show, the writers of ""The Last of Us"" realized that humans are much more intriguing than the mindless zombies around them. The gameplay keeps up with the presentation and narrative. Whether Joel is up against the infected or humans, stealth is key because ammunition is scarce. Quietly taking down foes is a key to success. When that fails, guns are needed, and Joel comes to acquire plenty of them.

Azyral,"Story/premise:  The Last of Us plot is unpredictable and truly terrifying, but it's about the two main characters, Joel and Ellie as they form a father/daughter relationship as they traverse through a post-apocalyptic United States claimed by nature. The story is dark and brutal, more so than any other game that I've ever played before. The infected in this game,is something unprecedented in the post-apocalytpic genre, as the humans are mutated and infected by a fungus known as Cordyceps.,,Visuals: The visuals of the Last of Us is beautiful and stunning. The textures are so rich in detail. Everything from the foliage, to the characters, to the world's objects are rife with details that one would think it's impossible for an 8 year old hardware to pump such impressive visuals. It might not be a huge leap from how Uncharted: Drake's Fortune to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves was, but it is certainy a leap, nonetheless. But that is to be expected from a developer that pushed the boundaries of graphics ahead of any game on consoles. It safe to say that The Last of Us in some way surpasses Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception,  many would agree this is the best looking game on consoles, and I agree.,Considering how Naughty Dog used every juice left in the PS3's aging hardware, it definitely is the best looking game on consoles.,,Gameplay: The gameplay is as I expected. Although to some it may not be fun due to the fact that the combat is supposed to be in a way realistic. Joel is a veteran, brutal and ruthless survivor, but that does not make him a super-solider where he could aim a gun with 100% accuracy, that's not to be expected from a game like The Last of Us.,Joel wobbles and has a sense of weight as he aims with his guns that he acquires throughout his journey, and that adds a sense of desperation and tension to the combat, it's really fun and challenging at the same time. But, of course, you could always improve the aiming and lessen the wobbly-ness by upgrading your skills by acquiring supplements throughout the game's,world. The crafting system is one of the best I've ever seen in a game, it's also all in real-time, so that adds another sense of tension as you have to be careful when to craft items. Fortunately, you're able to upgrade your skills to quickly craft an item. That being said, you're not able to upgrade all of Joel's skills at one-playthrough, so this encourages,players to play again through the New Game Plus option that retains your skills and upgrades from the previous saved game.,The close melee combat in the game is also brutal as you're able to pick up planks, pipes and hatchets and even upgrade them with spikes and barbed wires. It's effective to a certain extent, as the weapons you carried can break after a certain amount of hits than you've dealt to an enemy. The durability and strength of each weapon varies.,The gameplay also gives you the option to whether go in guns-blazing, but that's kind of a bad idea as ammos are scarce or if a player prefers to play stealthly. I can say that the stealth aspect of the game is fun. Joel can go into a Listen Mode that gives a highlight to enemies near by that makes sound, that adds another way for you to plan your next move and strategize.,You also have the ability to crouch this time around and the cover system is much more dynamic than what we're used to in the Uncharted games. Keep in mind that the Clickers are able to kill you in one bite, so you have to be careful, but you're still able to kill them with a shiv. Both the infecteds and the human conflicts and encounters are both equally challenging as the dynamic AI is unlike anything I've seen before.,Ellie does occasionally help by throwing a bottle or brick at an enemy when Joel is in danger, she'd also come running to you to help you as she stabs an enemy to free you. The same goes to other secondary characters that'll join in the adventure for a awhile. Replayability in this game is what you'd expect from games like the Uncharted series, with a lot of collectibles to find. The game took me literally 25 hours to complete as I was scouring every nook and cranny in the game for supplies. This is definitely the longest game, Naughty Dog has ever made. Add multiplayer, and you've got yourself a game worth purchasing.,Sound design: The sound design is astonishing and highly detailed in basically everything, but most of all is the terrifying sound of the Runners and Clickers that'll surely keep some players' heart pumping as they hear the clicking sound of a Clicker. Soundtrack is emotional and stunning.,,This game is a masterpiece and I can see why, with all the praise and perfect scores it garnered, this is one of the greatest game of this generation and probably of all time and one that'll surely be discussed for years to come. I give this game a perfect score. The ending certainly got me thinking for days, it was something unpredictable.",normal,ps3,2013-06-14,English,32,16,10,test

I was afraid that I would not get the full impact because I do not have surround sound, and I can only imagine what it is like playing the game with a massive entertainment system, but nonetheless even on a regular HDTV with no extra speakers, the sounds of the game truly are amazing.  The echoes off the walls, the birds and bugs buzzing around, amazing.  The game is flat-out beautiful, not only does it run well but the vibrant colors you experience as you play through the game.

Tycocelchu,"The Last of Us is that rare game that shows us what kind of potential the aging PS3 still has within itself. The Last of Us is a survival-horror game by Naughty Dog (creators of the Uncharted Series) that shows us just how bad life in a  post apocalyptic world can be. With breathtaking graphics its hard not to call The Last of US one of the most visually stunning games of recent history. The visual elements aren't even the tip of the iceberg for this gem. Sporting a compelling story and memorable main characters The Last of Us certainly brings alot to the table. There are some A.I. issues at times usually at times of tension where you have to be stealthy to avoid enemies but, your A.I. companions just carry out like like they own the place.The Last of Us is also one of the few (if not only) survival horror to include a multiplayer mode.

I feel the only reason why it's getting such scores is the publisher, but that's alright.,The gunplay is average, typical TPS fair. Really, if you're looking for gameplay innovation, it's not here. The whole ""scarce ammo so you have to scavenge"" thing is ruined by the fact that most of the enemies are guards, which drop ammo. The""zombies (they're zombies, don't lie to yourself)"" are generally clumped in areas and not dangerous, outside of clickers. For puzzles we have crate stacking, ladders, moving massive objects to stand on (Joel is superhuman) and motors. You'll be seeing these a lot because they're repeated more than HL2's physics puzzles. The game has stealth, which is does just as well as any other TPS game with stealth, but the AI is stupid, making it easier. It's really linear, shamefully linear. I think this is what kills me most about the game, the atmosphere is really good, ND nailed it with that, but they went NOWHERE with it. It's another linear story game that takes no risks. Walk, get into scripted scene, fight guards or zombies, cutscene. For 12 hours, that's the game. It occasionally changes things up, but that's essentially the game. I won't spoil the story, but it feels like the left it up for DLC and expansions, which is shameful. If you like really average story based games, go ahead. If you want more, maybe just rent it.

Just tried and true elements that feel comfortable, though you can debate whether that's a good thing in a game that's relying on you being drawn in.   If this was a TV Show, it'd definitely be worthy of a higher score.  The story is definitely quite good.  The problem is that its about as interactive as a painting.  They went with the 'Open Barn"" design philosophy of multiple paths all leading to the same set pieces.  This can be a fine choice, but when characters react as though you'd been in a running gun battle in the set piece,  when you literally did not make a sound, it really breaks the immersion.

Rolle,"Just completed the game in one sitting, took me 12 hours.,,The game is good. It's not great nor does it live up to the hype created around it. The graphics are very mediocre. Maybe it's just me because I'm used to FullHD resolution with AntiAliasing and Anisotropic Filtering on PC, but the game looked quite bad in some places. Low res textures, vegetation on most places is not an actual object, just some leaves painted on the texture. The game runs only in 720p which made it look even worse on my 24"" fullHD monitor, aliasing was everywhere. Additionally you can see the frame rate dropping to around 15-20 FPS, especially during some places in the cities. This makes it extremely hard to navigate and aim.,,Like I said, I completed the game after 12 hours and... it hanged after the credits screen. I could go to start menu but couldn't load, save or quit the game, so I had to shut down the game through PS menu. Started it up again to see what bonuses I unlocked by completing the game and... my save was gone. So yeah, I'm quite pissed off right now, 12 hours for nothing. Nice quality assurance testing there.,,Now, onto the game itself. The story is nowhere near as driving and immersing as the one in ""The Walking Dead"", which I consider the best adventure game I ever played. There are a few good moments, but most of the time the game play is limited to running around buildings collecting items and shooting bandits. The cut scenes are awesome, the voices and animations are really good, but there's not that many of them. I wish the story was narrated better and didn't just skip through parts. The story is 100% linear, as far as I know, there are no choices in game you can make to affect the story, so there is no re-playability value what-so-ever. In the end I never got attached to any of the characters like I did in ""The Walking Dead"".,,I liked the character of Ellie, although because I couldn't make any choices on how to interact with her and Joel is an a-hole most of the time, I never made that ""bond"" which would make me miss her even outside the game. Throughout the game you can sometimes stop and talk to Ellie, but it is so rare event that it doesn't really add anything to the experience, especially that you have no control over what they talk about and it's usually just small talk about surroundings or recent events. The ending is disappointing, but I guess you'll just have to figure this one on your own.,,Developers advertised the game with the AI that is clever and it will try to outsmart you. Ha, what a joke. The AI completely ignores your companions, they can run in front of a bandit and the guy couldn't care less. Enemies actually try to take alternative routes to get you and flank you, but most of the time they just barge into the room and stand there thinking ""now what?"". Your companions are pretty much invisible when sneaking, so you don't really have to care about them unless they are grabbed by an enemy. This made me really detach from my character and I didn't really care for my companions much.,,There are also some design problems I do not really understand like weapon mechanics. Shivs are used to kill the clickers, but you lose them every time you use them, like ammo. Since when are knives one use only? Same with some of the melee weapons, steel pipes go bad after 7 hits. Some weapons are badly unbalanced, like the shotgun. In later stages of the game, where soldiers have bulletproof vests and helmets it can take up to 4 shotgun body shots to kill one soldier from about 4-5 meters away. To make it more ridiculous max ammo for the shotgun is like 16 rounds.,,Overall, it's not a bad game, but it isn't nowhere the GOTY and I think the 10/10 reviewers didn't play through the whole game. About half way into the game I was already tired of collecting the same items over and over again and playing hide and seek with the bandits on stages clearly designed for combat (scattered objects to use as cover which are placed so obviously, upon seeing them you know there will be enemies around). I was hoping for another experience like in ""The Walking Dead"" but unfortunately I am very disappointed.,,Positive:,+ Good script and game setting,+ Awesome, but rare cut scenes,+ Environments,+ Animations and voice acting,+ Ellie character,,Negative:,- Graphics,- Linear and very predictable story,- Lack of interactivity with the characters,- Dumb AI,- Some game mechanics",normal,ps3,2013-06-14,English,95,28,6,test
Emporia,"I usually just sit and read reviews, but I felt compelled to give a short, accurate review. I am six hours into the game, and I must say, I've been getting quite bored of it. Ohhhh no, I'm in the dark and there are clickers walking around; now what.......um, it took me 10 minutes to navigate around them slowly. Wow, fun. Granted the visuals can be nice at times, but the gameplay, story, etc is nothing new. We've seen this before. I think the game is quite overrated if you ask me. I love Naughty Dog and they've done a good job again, but not a 10. I think the critics  media followed suit because for it to score this high is a bit disturbing. Nonetheless, it is a good game. If you have $60, love Naughty Dog, and are looking for a good game to keep you going until the PS4, then go for it. This will take some time to platinum. If you're going to buy this based on the perfect 10's it's getting, I'm sorry to say, I think you will be disappointed. In the end, to each their own.....happy gaming guys.",normal,ps3,2013-06-14,English,120,35,6,train
holden,"I don't want to spoil any of the story so I'll get right to the point; The Last of Us takes all the WORST parts of the Uncharted series (the stealth and sneaking) and stretches it out across 12 hours of gameplay.  This is THE MOST overrated game I have ever played.  I cannot believe people are trying to say this game is ""the best game ever"" and better than Uncharted 3, which was an utter masterpiece, or better than this years BioShock Infinite, which was another amazing game.  I went to the midnight launch and beat the game in one sitting so I didn't have to deal with the horrible save-game bug right now that prevents you from saving your progress, so I'm not even factoring that horrible oversight into my review.  Honestly though, save yourself $60 and put that money towards a next-gen console.  The multiplayer is also incredibly generic and unbalanced.  Whoever wins the first round wins the entire match because they can instantly afford a set of armor at the start of the next round which allows you to take twice as much damage before dying.  I'm utterly shocked by the metascore the critics have given this game.

Who knows maybe you will buy into the hype and get easily manipulated like the Masses. Ift his game was not made by Naughty Dog and made by a not well known Dev then I bet you that this game would get low scores. People that give good scores to a game for not being all that great makes the gaming community worse. You give a game a good review and its not good, Devs will just make the same crap and get away with it and take your money and laugh at you.

Xplocion,"The good:,Great third person shooter game. Inventory management. Awesome graphics. Here the Let behind DLC is included. It has Multiplayer.,,The bad:,I did see The Road (Dimension Films, 2009) in the cinema, this game takes a lot of inspiration from that movie, not to say that it traces certain parts. Lots of motion blur that hides background errors but focuses the player's attention on the foreground and faces. After passing the impact of the graphics, after 30 minutes the game becomes repetitive and you have to constantly search for the bandages. Enemy AI is painful, enemies are bullet sponges. Ellie's AI is painful and in shootings she got stuck in walls or projections, the ""smart idea"" to justify this was: ""she's invisible to enemies"" (face-palm) when in Resident Evil 4 we see that Ashlie is just as useless in AI if she can be injured and the game is even over if she dies ...,,What Meh:,It is a game besides that it traces to the Movie The Road is good but not the masterpiece that everyone says. You ask many about parts that you liked about the game and the unanimous answer is the giraffe, because that is what the press showed them, after that little or nothing they know later and at least here is the Let Behind DLC where you can see it Ellie's preferences long before ""it became fashionable to be on the side of political correctness and gender diversity.""

BenLea,"The last of us is one of the best games I have ever played. In the beginning the game is seemingly just your average zombie story, with mediocre characters and good graphics. As the game develops, you begin to care for these characters, gaining a deeper understanding of their individual personalities, making you want to continute to play to see how they develop and see what happens to them. The game easily switches between a calming walk through a forest, and into an intense fight against a bunch of clickers. The way that the characters interact with each other is immaculate, and enhances the story, deepening your love for the characters.,,However, there are some bad things about the game, like sometimes a character won't know what to do and just stands there, or a character will get in your way while you're shooting, and also the fact that the other characters seem to be immune to sound and can sprint around whenever they want but other than that,,,This game is a masterpiece. 9/10",normal,ps4,2021-03-05,English,0,0,9,train

Fighting mechanics work really well with pretty good AI which provides a good challenge.

HeavyMachineGon,"在这个开放世界泛滥，动不动就几十上百个小时的游戏的年代，能有这么一个纯线性游戏的系列，还是非常值得赞扬（虽然2015年的游戏我2021才玩）。完全线性，没有岔路，单纯享受游戏过程和剧情，很久没有这种酣畅淋漓的感觉了，主线10几个小时，建议一口气通关。而且很适合多周目尝试不同的难度作战方式。经常玩游戏的人可以直接从困难开始玩，我平常玩游戏平均每天1-2小时，选的普通难度觉得稍微有点简单，感觉敌人智商有点低，特别是人类。,游戏有点像半条命2和战神（2018）的结合，末日背景下的亲子合作闯关，游戏过程也是激战+缓和交替进行。战神后出，或者说战神借鉴了美末的设定呢？,玩法很多，而且还有潜行，这个我是没有想到的。在解决关卡的时候可以选择潜行，可以选择硬刚，也可以打游击战。武器和道具的种类比较丰富，尤其是枪支，从手枪，到弓箭再到喷火枪应有尽有。人物和装备升级以及制作物品非常简单，都是靠捡垃圾（收集资源）来实现，这就让人老想盯着地上和桌子看，看有没有可以捡的道具，而容易忽略画面整体的美术性。,感染者敌人主要有3种，人类敌人只有一种，整体来说种类有点少，而且人类敌人的智商明显比感染者低很多，就算潜行被发现了，只要能跑掉就能再次潜行，就算不能跑掉，能找到障碍物掩护，枪战也不怕。但是前期装备少，乔尔也没怎么升级，有点容易死，特别是被寻声者抓到，后期物资和等级上去之后其实就不太容易死了。,有一定的收集要素，除了漫画还有吊坠，个人觉得漫画比吊坠更有意义，但如果没有收集要素其实对这个游戏来说更好，更不用分心了。,配乐比较出彩，吉他的弦乐非常有末日的无奈感，也有划破黑暗看到黎明曙光的新生感。而且音乐的频率刚刚好，不会盖过游戏更不会出戏。,人物建模和面部表情都比较自然，很喜欢艾莉成熟独立的嗓音。,吐槽下，这游戏的成就奖杯，真的有点少，而且很难，大多是收集要素和升级到满级，有的成就一周目基本上是不可能的。剧情类成就通关后才有唯一一个，可以在完成每个大的章节以后给一个奖杯以表示鼓励。",normal,ps4,2021-01-31,Not identified,0,0,10,train

Blast1qq,"Это было увлекательное путешествие, полное драммы, умора, экшена, стелса, жестокости и некоторых элементов РПГ. Эта игра про постапокалипсис - то время, где человечество пало на колени, горечь утраты, жизнь весящая на волоске, об этом напоминает игра, она очень серьёзная и реалистичная. Я играл в не малое количество игр про апокалипсис, но эта запомнилась больше всего. Игра не просто говорит, она показывает всю жестокость и потери, которые есть у каждого персонажа. После игры не очень то и хочется чтобы наступал апокалипсис. Это сильная и смелая игра. Постоянно кто-то умирает, умирает так, что у тебя идёт небольшая дрожь. В Last of us великолепные кат-сцены, киноматографичные, интересные. Диалоги очень крутые, персонажи реалистичны, как и их речь, веет харизмой. Также в нужных местах вставлен умор, его хватает. Так же дует главных героев напоминает дует из Бога войны (Оно и понятно, в год оф вар система напарников почти полностью взята из ласт оф ас). Также в игре есть не только драмма, экшен, и умор, но и медитативность. Игра, если близко нет врагов не заставляет тебя нестись сломя голову, она даёт тебе обыскать всю локацию от и до. Но от части она заставляет тебя щарится в каждом углу, часто не хватает боеприпасов, медикаментов, запчастей (и это только на среднем уровне сложности), недостаток припасов часто напрягает, что больше погружает в атмосферу апокалипсиса. Этот недостаток припасов пораждает стелс, который в этой игре просто невероятный и очень интересный. У тебя постоянно сжато очко, у тебя 6 патронов и 6 противников, что затавляет играть скрытно. Для скрытного убийства нужны ножи, которые ломаются и нужно щарится по местности, что бы найти материалы для их изготовления. Игра очень прекрасно спроектированна. Сюжет в игре неплохой, но главный в Last of us является не он, а драмма, постоянные сопереживания, главный героям, второстепенным, чёрт, я даже сопереживал челу из записок! Карл! Это потрясающе.

I'd wasted hundreds if not thousands of hours gaming and thought that was it for me. After reading lots of reviews and buckling to the hype I decided to get a PS4 just for The Last Of Us and have never regretted this decision.,The Last Of Us (TLOU) is more than a game, it would be fine to sit there and watch the entirety of the game as a cinematic. The story builds the characters, you learn to feel their pain, joy, and relied along the way. I didn't think a game would affect me so much, there are key scenes which really hit home hard. I've never experienced a game of this storytelling prowess and I almost hope not to again as I want to cherish this story. The music stuck in my head for days, weeks and even months. I wanted to learn the guitar just so I could reproduce the songs. Tell me what games have had this effect in you? I doubt many if any. The voice acting was solid and really helped suck you into the story, I think this was crucial to believing the story.,The gameplay worked for me and I really enjoyed the options of running and gunning or stealth.  The difficulty settings allow you to actually play through how you want, finishing it in normal before progressing to survivor was real fun.,I have always been a player who likes to emerse themselves psychologically into a game and have felt great connection to characters before, but TLOU was different. I didn't necessarily relate to Joel or Ellie but I did want them to succeed and to fight with them. I finished TLOU on survivor mode in 2019 and feel that survivor mode makes it feel less like a game and more real world.

Esta muy bien llevado el tema de que los ""zombies"" tengan varias fases de infección cada una mas peligrosa que la anterior, y que para eliminarlos haya que usar el ingenio y el sigilo, pues el juego da armas cada bastante tiempo y la munición es extremadamente escasa. También me gusta mucho como llevan el tema de que en gran parte del juego son mas peligrosos otros humanos que los propios infectados, hay incluso algunas zonas que puedes pasar sin matar un solo infectado.,La historia y su final son un 10/10 y a los personajes con sus virtudes y defectos se les coge mucho cariño. También incluye un modo online que no hay por donde cogerlo y tal vez para mi tiene algún aspecto en la jugabilidad no tan pulido, pero es insignificante comparado con el resto de cosas que ofrece el juego. 100% recomendado su modo individual.",normal,ps4,2020-09-23,Spanish,0,0,9,train

И в нее точно надо играть самому, а не смотреть прохождение. Пусть в геймплее она прихрамывает, но The Last of Us надо прочувствовать на собственной шкуре.,,- Визуал 9/10 - Выглядит игра шикарно, особенно для 2014 года. Motion capture во всей красе. Природа отрисована отлично. К недочетам отнесу некоторые ""игрушечные"" объекты интерьеров, небольшие проблемы с текстурами и то, что все круглые объекты - шестиугольные (таков уж Havok). В общем почти идеально.,,- Аудио 5/5 Атмосферные саундтреки, всегда идеально дополняющие происходящее. Настоящий живой мир с ветром, животными, и иными шумами  Отлично отработаны звуки шагов на разных типах поверхности. Отдельно отмечу круто реализованные звуки из дуалшока.,,- Повествование 10/10,Действительно очень сильный сюжет, заставляющий прочувствовать целую палитру эмоций. Тут есть и страх и злость, и досада и принятие, и безнадёга и превозмогание, проблемы взросления и усталость от жизни, да чего тут только нет. А последнее ""Клянусь"" даёт огромное количество пищи для размышлений...,,- Техническое исполнение 4/5 - почти все хорошо, но встречаются баги с застреванием в союзниках, прохождения сквозь некоторые объекты, и внезапно исчезающие враги. Однако, сильно это не мешает.,,- Геймплей 14/20 - основную компанию я проходил на нормальной сложности, и это было ошибкой тк ближе к середине игры я ощущал себя уже суперменом. А вот DLC на максимальном уровне уже подарило мне настоящее ощущение сурвайвала. Хотя и на высших сложностях , непосредственно игровой процесс, я бы не назвал увлекательным. Зато атмосферным это уж точно. Тяжесть судьбы героев действительно ощущаешь на себе. Уровни пустые, хотя какими им ещё быть в таких-то обстоятельствах, так что это даже плюс, что надо очень постараться чтобы найти лут. Присутствуют невидимые стены и каменные кусты. Раздражали переодически респавнящийся из воздуха враги.,Стэлс, когда герой один, даже дарит ощущение страха за героя. А вот когда с тобой союзники, то ведут себе они очень тупо - шумят, кричат, лезут на рожон, но самое плохое ,что при этом врагам на них плевать. А учитывая, что это основной элемент игры, это очень большой минус. Что до боевки, то тут я так и не понял - толи она сделана плохо, толи так и было задумано, чтобы я на своей шкуре чувствовал что всегда что-то может пойти не так...,,Как и в начале повторюсь - хоть игровой процесс и не выдающийся, но сюжет однозначно рекомендуется к прохождению.

smb111,"A Masterpiece. The characters, the storytelling, and the world Naughty Dog built was incredible. I played on the PS3, then the PS4, and then on the hardest setting. For such a cruel, almost depressing world, I never wanted to leave it over the years. Perhaps that was because of the small nuggets of absolute beauty that were smattered throughout the game. And the love between the characters in the game. Another thing that really rang true for this game wasn't even the undead (clickers/runners/etc.), although those were terrifying enough. But honestly, it was the evil and cruelty that came from humans, our lowest points as civilization tore down around us that made the game feel authentic. Even the ""best"" characters had a dark side, and secrets from the past that they didn't want to share, or didn't want to recall because what they did to survive was so horrible...it almost took away their humanity. The story, and the choices of the main characters are deep enough to make you have to think. Thinking, particularly in a game focused on storytelling, is the key to a beautiful game. The characters, their interactions, and even the end of this game leave you thinking about a great many things: What would you be willing/unwilling to do in the same situation? What would people do if civilizations crumbled around them? Are there good and bad people, or just people? Would you be willing to...well, I won't ruin the end of the game.

Same goes for the ps4 version, both versions have the same pros and cons in my opinion, since i had on both versions bugs that were frustrating and triggered me, i also had an incredible experience. But the Remaster is the absolute experience of The Last of Us, not only because they inproved both frame rate to 60Fps and the resolution to 1080p, which makes the Gameplay way better and smoother. But they also added the stand alone DLC Left Behind which is incredibly good! So if you ever have the chance to get this game, get it!

Но не стоит забывать что игра это не только сюжет, но и геймплей. Даже сейчас, в 2020 году, багов не то чтобы много, но их и не мало. На протяжении всей игры, я встретил порядка 6 багов. Некоторые из них критичные, что приходилось перезапускать игру с последней КТ (Джоэл застрял в текстуре горы, во время поиска Элли, вместе с Томми, на лошадях). Элементы стелса не впечатляют в 2020 году, но это игра 2014 года, и судя по тем меркам...стелс в игре пусть и не на все 10, но на 8 потянет. Что мы имеем в итоге?

EdwardG,"The Last of Us starts with one of its best sequences. Seeing the beginning of the outbreak through the eyes of a scared little girl was extremely compelling - the panic and confusion in this tense opening was truly great.,,Things slow down a little after the time jump, and it feels less gripping for a while. After spending some time with Ellie and Joel, however, it becomes clear why this game is held in such high regard. Seeing the relationship between the two main characters develop is what made me want to keep playing. They're well written, and the game does a good job making you care for them. Although the story and setting aren't very original, the narrative is still quite strong thanks to it's tone and, again, the characters.,,The gameplay is fun for the most part, but there are some annoyances like the clickers that can kill you in one hit until you've unlocked a certain upgrade. There's a lot of just walking around slowly too, but it's not much of a problem because this is still a very pretty game despite being a remaster of a last gen release, and the sights of The Last of Us are often worth slowing down to see. It's not all slow paced though, and there are some great action setpieces including one where you flank a sniper, and then use his weapon to defend your allies. The ending is great too, as it's action packed and you're given some strong motivation to fight in those final moments of the game.,,I loved Left Behind, the DLC that comes bundled with the PS4 remaster. It was another tense experience filled with emotion and more excellent character work. It does some different things with the mechanics of the game, using it's systems in charming new ways to help convey Ellie and Riley's relationship.,,Overall, I liked The Last of Us Remastered a lot, but I do think the moment to moment gameplay could've been better. There's a lot of moving about slowly, and although the combat can feel nice and visceral, the stealth and action gameplay isn't on the same level as the game's characters, narrative and performances, which are fantastic.

When engaging in a melee fight with another human, you feel like you the player and the NPC are fighting for their life.

CuppaFueled,"Nerd Notes: I played this on a PS4 Pro using the framerate prioritisation mode, Standard Dualshock 4 controller, sitting a little over 8 feet from a 55” 1080p Samsung TV, for audio I used Bose AE2i Headphones, dynamic range setting was set as wide as possible for more immersion & I played on Normal difficulty.,,It’s 2020 and whilst I spend allot of time last year playing through all 5 Uncharted titles on PS4. I have never played The Last of us. Bars & expectations were exceedingly high for this 2013 masterpiece & If anything I was scared if this game was going to have aged well in 2020.,Story: Just when it feels as though we’ve had every ‘zombie’ story, The Last of Us swings a mean right hook and hits you with a story that’s not only damn right brilliant.,,The main characters: Joel & Ellie performed by Troy Baker & Ashley Johnson are some of the most polished & interesting characters I’ve ever had the pleasure to game as, I don’t want to give much away so I won’t go into more detail. But Joel & Ellie are not the end of this story, the supporting characters as well as factions are so memorable & brilliantly executed, games in 2020 still don’t have it as good as this!,,As you traverse the world you come across notes which add a whole new dimension to the game, letting you know that there are far more survivors out there. In most games I find notes like these to add very little to the story, but in The Last of Us it just makes you appreciate how vast,The story stands.,,The Last of us’ story sparks curiosity. Meaning not all stories are rounded off, it leaves you with questions, which is a good thing! So much media tries to round off every story told and sell it off as ‘fan service’ but I’m a big fan of how I would go to bed at night after playing The Last of Us and wondering what was going to happen, how something might have happened & what would it be like if this happened instead! That is a testament to how great this game’s story is, it sticks with you long after putting the controller down.,,Gameplay:  I was surprised how well The Last of Us still plays, the shooting I found to be a little rickety at the start, but as you upgrade throughout the story shooting becomes allot more fluid (I’m also an arse when it comes to shooting generally, which doesn’t help).,,Resorsed such as ammo are limited in The Last of Us, but did find it frustrating that not all enemies (who definitely carried guns) seemingly had no ammo when taken down.. I could understand this in more hardcore difficulty settings, but felt it was a little ‘forced’ It did however force me to play differently, use different weapons, techniques etc. so it’s swings and roundabouts.,,I knew going in that there was allot of stealth involved but I was happy that should you get spotted it doesn’t alert every enemy to your location, you’re able to takedown and hide which was great! Something we still don’t see enough of in 2020!,,I enjoyed the puzzle solving, there was a tasteful amount, without running into puzzles left, right & centre.,,I mentioned earlier that The Last of Us sparks curiosity, this remains true in all aspects, every building you enter there is usually a good reward for going off the track to explore, I did allot of exploring and still have so much more to see & I cannot wait for my next playthrough!,,Graphics:,,You know what? Even by today’s standards… this is a very pretty game! The textures were tac sharp, shadows were crispy fresh & the animation was the stellar quality you expect from Naughty Dog!,,I had a few times where aliasing was a thing, but this was just a very inherent issue for the PS3/360 era of gaming so I can’t judge too harshly for that, plus if I had a higher resolution TV and used the favour resolution mode I’d suspect this would have been less noticeable.,,The game looks great, I really don’t know what else to say, It was ahead of it’s time visually when it released in 2013 and I think it’ll remain pretty timeless because everything is just so well done!,,Sound/Music: The music really glues the elements of this game together, it’s got this raw naturalistic, striped back & built up vibe which seamlessly fits into the world of The Last of Us.,,The sound design is very good! It goes for a more neutral stance, (Rant: I’m not a fan of games where someone is talking to you from the other side of the room & it sounds like they’re right in your earhole). However when characters are far away you hear the reverberation of the voice more than the direct source which really transports you to the environments you’re exploring!,,Conclusion: If for whatever reason you’ve not played The Last of Us, I recommend that you do!,It’s on the ‘Playstation Hits’ so in the UK its around £15 and often goes on sale, it’s a game you definitely won’t want to miss out on.",normal,ps4,2020-08-17,English,0,0,10,train

drcoomer,"I'm super late to the party on this one, I know. But with a game THIS good, I had to jump in and write this review. I'm actually writing this a month after finishing TLOU and TLOU II so it's not super fresh in my mind. But not many games have stuck with me like this one so I'm going to do my best.,,Graphics: 10/10,I remember playing this game for about 30 minutes on my older brother's PS3 when the game first game out. I was 17 at the time and I remember being so impressed with the scene with Joel and Tommy in the truck and being able to move side-to-side and look out the windows at all the carnage. I know today that's probably not a very groundbreaking feature, but back then I was super impressed and it stuck with me for 7 years until I finally bought and played the remastered version myself. That's just a little personal tidbit that carried some weight with me. All in all, the graphics are stunning from start to finish and every cut scene feels as if it's way ahead of its time. Absolutely nothing to complain about there.,,Narrative: 10/10,Engaging, heart-wrenching, terrifyingly beautiful.,It is the heaviest story I've ever experienced in a video game and one of the only games that truly left me shook. It absolutely ripped me apart, and after the credits rolled I just sat there for about 10 minutes in silence. A lot of TV shows and movies should take notes!,,Protagonist: 10/10,Joel and Ellie will forever be two of my favorite characters in any piece of media. i could probably fill the rest of my 5000 character limit on this section alone. But I will leave it at that.,,Characters/Interactions: 10/10,The side characters that we are introduced to all effectively carry their own weight within the narrative. They are woven in and out of the story beautifully and each leave a punctual mark on your experience.,,Villain: 10/10,There's a lot to unpack regarding the ""villain"" of this game and who/what that actually is, but I want to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible so I won't get into it much. Some people say its ABC and some say it's XYZ, and that's fine. Discourse is a good thing! But again, this goes back to the writing and ND's ability to draw these discussions out that makes this game so amazing.,,Editing/cut scenes: 10/10,Perfectly done. My jaw literally dropped and I gasped audibly at one point towards the beginning of the game (I think those of you who have played it know what I'm talking about). Everything about the editing is A+. The voice acting is superb (ILY Ashley Johnson). The little details like voice cracks, deep breaths, long pauses really make these scenes feel REAL and the conversations feel authentic. There's a sense of gravity in every single cut scene and it just gets heavier and heavier as the game goes on, and honestly, it's exhausting. And I mean that in the best way possible.,,Gameplay: 10/10,It's a pretty simple style. Hide and shoot. But it's effective and not once did it get boring. The lack of ammo makes it that much harder and sometimes you have to really be creative. Playing from multiple points-of-view really adds to the experience as well.,,All in all, this game is about as perfect as it can get. It resonates with me to this day and I don't think I could say a bad thing about it if I tried. Bravo, Naughty Dog!,,Overall Score: 10/10",normal,ps4,2020-08-10,English,0,0,10,train

YaBoiFirmi,"Okay now, I know i’m 7 YEARS late but sadly i wasn’t aware of this website and all but i still want to share my thoughts about this game. Okay Where do i begin, let’s obviously begin with the beginning to where you have this guy who is named Joel and his daughter Sarah and them having a funny and nice father daughter moment together. The game then has you waking up as Sarah and man the rest of it what happens is just amazing. The game throws you into chaos almost immediately with sadly having you see Sarah dying in Joel’s arms. That scene was so good, but also so sad that i actually shed a tear and not a lot of games do that to me but man this game actually made me shed a tear which is awesome now looking back on it. You then see Joel become this smart individual who plays every situation smart and is always cautious about LITERALLY everything and how he does lots of smuggling behind the government’s back. You also get to meet his friend Tess to which is a very underrated character. You then get to meet Ellie to which after playing this game  TONS and TONS of time, Ellie is hands down the most awesome and just a well developed character out of the whole game. I love how Joel and Ellie’s relationship starts out suspicious of one another and not really caring about each other but they eventually develop this father daughter relationship which is just beautiful. Now even though the story is predictable and all its okay because the dialogue in between cutscenes and just in general make up for it. There are no throw away characters and all of them are interesting and serve a purpose. The environments in the world is just amazing and beautiful and to be honest, I would LOVE to be apart of the world too. The also loved how you learn more about the fireflies and the “cure” to which yes the “cure” was not guaranteed and the fireflies have also failed numerous times in making a cure. The game then throws you a twist to where Joel is injured and you take control of Ellie. That to me is beautiful writing and a really nice twist. This also helps develop Ellie’s character even more too. However, i did run into some glitches here and there but none of the glitches i found were game breaking or annoying. They were honestly just really funny and I didn’t even mind them. Also, the multiplayer i did not play a-lot in but i will say that with the little time i got with it, i REALLY enjoyed my time and was honestly just fun. Now I would say that i hope there is a sequel and how happy i would be with it. But as I am making this review, there is already a sequel out to which I have already given my review with it. All in all though, this a great game with beautiful graphics for its time, great storytelling, great characters, and just great all around in pretty much every part of this game.",normal,ps4,2020-08-07,English,0,0,10,train

As one of the best games of all-time, the more places it is and the more people that can play it, the better. One of the best new features of TLOU:R is the extensional larger framerate.

It is visually a gorgeous game with one of the finest depictions of post apocalyptic society I have ever seen. It is a slower and more somber game than I expected, but never boring. It mixes genres flawlessly and thus it avoids feeling repetitive. Gameplay is nothing groundbreaking. Its your standard 3rd person cover shooter but it succesfully implements different weapons, tools and stealth system so you always have a variety of ways to tackle each situation. The stars of the game are, however its story and characters.

Luigichief,"I played this game in early 2019 and I didn't like it at all, but in July 2020 I replayed it entirely and changed my opinion. The first time I played the game I was shoot all my way through it, I didn't use stealth once (brick and bottle none at all) and maybe that's why I didn't think the gameplay was any good, just a shooter that you need to save ammo on. In my second game I was about 90% stealth, I was trying to get through each mission without using a bullet, just sneaking between enemies, with bricks, bottles and a little of melee. Exploration is very rewarding and almost essential to the game. I thought that playing more in the stealth gives an air of survivor and contributed to my immersion, but this is very personal (except that personally I found the normal way too easy). The game has a very realistic air but for gameplay sake, there are a lot of things that aren't.,,The story is very simple and basic (in my first game I went with **** up hype and I was quite frustrated with it). It is a journey, from point A to point B (what can be considered a differential is that point B changes) that has the objective of saving the world. But for me this is not the good part of the game, as most people say (I believe that they express themselves wrong), but rather focus on the characters, their stories (backgrounds), their growth, their interactions and their relationships . But seriously, what the script does half-heartedly in the story it makes up for in all aspects of the characters and I believe that was the goal. So don't play this game expecting a complex story, totally unpredictable, epic, full of twists or something. But even without any of this, it is very immersive and you want to see what will happen next and all this thanks to the characters (the story even had 2 events that were unpredictable and they were good). But the only part that I really liked about the story was the ending. He's very unexpected and dark, I liked him a lot, but in the end he ends up being the merit of the characters too. Another thing that didn't really please me was the timeskips, it gave an air of history and a certain skip team “skipped” all the consequences of certain deaths and how they affected Joel and Ellie. And I never thought I would say that but the direction of this game is very good and very smart, it manages to provide the best experience possible in the cutscenes. The dialogues that take place while you explore are something that I really liked (especially at the beginning of the game, then unfortunately they decrease a lot). The level design of this game is very good, the scenarios are very detailed, full of personality and therefore are very immersive.,,The characters in general are very complex and well humanized, everyone has their defects and make mistakes. But the really good characters are Joel and Ellie, because they are the protagonists they have a lot of focus, are very deep, have cool interactions to see and have a nice development. For me they practically carried the game on their backs.,,The soundtrack is ok. The dubbing is excellent and so are the sound effects.,,The diversity of 'zombies' is very low, there are 3 types of zombies (you can't even compare with Left for Dead for example). Another thing that bothered me a bit is that there are no boss fights in the game. Even in 2020 the game in the remastered edition (v1.10 if I'm not mistaken) still has bugs, which I found very strange. But this game is very overrated and for me it is definitely not the best of the decade, generation or something.",normal,ps4,2020-07-26,English,0,0,8,train

blurryface197,"(English is not my mother language so excuse the spelling mistakes) This is surely one of the best games ever, so far my favorite, played it for the first time on the PS3 and then bought it again for the PS4, the enhanced quality make it looks great even today and I wish there could be another remastered version for the upcoming PS5. As far as game play goes this (with the Uncharted series) is one of my favorite, not to mention the amazing acting, music and all the tech side in general. But where this game shine is in storytelling and characters. The game play per se is a 3rd person shooting/stealth game in an apocalyptic zombie world, what makes it special are the story and the characters. Even the ones you see just for a small part of the game are unforgettable, not to mention the two main characters which, to me, represent the best game characters I've ever seen in a video game, with such a special relationship that made me fell in love with them as if they were real. Witnessing the change of both Joel and Ellie throughout their journey is an unique experience, seeing how all the walls Joel built around himself for the past 20 years melt little by little in the year he and Ellie spent together is truly an amazing achievement as fas as character growth in a video game of roughly 12 hours. Also the ending, which put not only Joel but us as players, in a moral dilemma where you ask yourself if the choice he made was right or wrong is what make this game amazing. And when the credit rolls, and in your mind you can still see Ellie's doubting face and the echo of her ""ok"" is still fresh you still wonder what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong and what anyone of us would have done in Joel's shoes. The Last of Us is one of those experience people will cherish forever, like it happens with special books, movies, tv shows and music. It become part of our lives and something that will stay with us. And even if the story is dark, violent and gory there's always a spark of light and hope throughout it.

piuscorvus,"I have never been a fan of games with horror zombie apocalypse topics. I played some of them such as The Evil Within games, tried one Resident Evil game and few others. The common thing for all those games (in my opinion) was that they are very successful in making you scared and uncomfortable but when it comes to the storylines - they were all so thin and weak, sometimes even pointless. I am fine with gore and fear but if that is the only point in the game then I do not find it really interesting.,I have been avoiding playing The Last of Us because I thought it is just another zombie game but when I finally started playing I saw after two hours of gameplay that this game is completely different. This is the first game with such topic (zombie outbreak) that I liked and it definitely is the best game with zombies and one of the best games that I have ever played and that is because it only uses the zombie apocalypse as an atmosphere in which context lies a story about Joel, the adult and Ellie, fourteen year old girl, who are on their journey through the country. The game puts an accent on the story and does not have a gameplay based on infinite shooting at zombies, or how they call them in the game, infected. It is far from that but the gameplay is far from a piece of cake and it should also satisfy gamers who are into action and shooting, especially if they select harder difficulty modes.,I played both PS3 and PS4 version of this game and visually it is one of the best looking games for PS3. Even in 2020, 7 years after it was released, this game still looks very nice being put next to some other good looking PS4 titles. The PS4 remastered version has a little visual improvements such as full HD resolution and more fps.,Speaking of a gameplay, The Last of Us does not bring many innovations - it rather improves some stuff that we already saw in third person action-adventure games. The gameplay perfectly combines exploration and combat with cutscenes without overdoing each of those. You can play this game in many ways. You can be aggressive and shoot everything at your sight but you can also sneak and be quiet. There are many ways of passing through the areas and for the most part you can really choose if you want to assassinate your enemies or find a way around.,Through the game you will find different sorts of weapons and there is a crafting system allowing you to make improvised bombs and melee weapons.,Another part of a gameplay is walking and exploration followed by interesting dialogs.,The Last of Us has a very fine acting, one of the best I saw in video games, which an emotional story of this game certainly needs, a story that most of the players would breathlessly follow until the end.",normal,ps4,2020-07-24,English,0,0,10,train
asadrocky,"I've always believed ""nothings perfect,"" then I played this game. The Last of Us is, at its core, a simple story/narrative told flawlessly.  The story is about the relationship between Joel and Ellie which is developed flawlessly and at a perfect pace through well-timed story beats, relatable dialogue, environmental storytelling, and even combat. Moments of darkness are offset by moments of light, both that contribute to the narrative. Every single side character Joel and Ellie come across strengthens their personal motivations, their bond, all while having a believable arc of their own. Combat fits the world perfectly, and Ellie's scrappiness is conveyed perfectly through how she develops during combat sequences. The development of Joel and Ellie's father/surrogate daughter relationship feels very real, relatable, and honest, and the ending will have you asking yourself morally complex questions.

Another aspect of the game that stuck out to me was the combat.

Andrea93,"No videogame is without flaws, and The Last of Us makes no exception. But what makes a 10? It's not the absence of flaws or faults; any piece of literature, narrative or so on - each in its own medium - is a 10 when it answers positively to the question: would the medium itself (videogame in this case) be poorer without this piece of media? In the case of The Last of Us, the answers is yes.,Now, we are in 2020 and the game is considered by this year's perspective, but it would be better judged as a 2013 game (2014 for this Remastered, which really improves the graphics of the game and makes it look easily as a game from this generation). The Last of Us is a videogame that presents many flaws, especially in gameplay mechanics and in AI quality. Not to talk about some puzzles, which may appear repetitive at a point. But the videogame in its whole is just unique, and enhances the medium. I personally have a lot of fun playing the game, mechanics are interesting and - especially if played at high difficulty settings, such as survivor or grounded - it really challenges you in finding new ways to beat the levels. You may want to run away, sneak out or just clean the level by beating all the enemies, according to the specific situation in which you find yourself. And it's all up to you and your personal attitude as a player, to your inventive and your will to challenge yourself. So the game really gives the best when played at least at hard mode. As we've just said, the only flaws the game has is in the gameplay and in the level design; when it comes to the story, The Last of Us is just mesmerizing. Naughy Dog was able to create two of the most iconic characters ever in the industry over night: Joel and Ellie are so powerful in their development, their relationship, their attitude, that simply stand over most of any other character ever produced by any videogame - and they maybe go even a little further, elevating videogame and its narrative possibilities to places where no other medium can go. As a videogame player, is up to you to turn the camera, decide the frame you want to watch, how much time you want to spend rushing the area or wandering around, just to discover that particular line, to see what Ellie does, how she acts differently throughout the playthrough depending on the level of affection she has towards Joel. The story is told not just through cutscenes, but with gameplay as well, melting the two things in a unique and very peculiar way to feel affection for both Joel and Ellie.,,Now, this is not a review and the space is just too limited to discuss any aspect of the game, this is just a little taste of one of the best story told, not just by a videogame, with two of the most beautiful, faceted and deep characters you may ever find. This is just why a videogame, with all its flaws and faults, is a full 10 and beyond. The Last of Us is a cornerstone for narrative and storytelling, and its legacy will go on as long as narrative and storytelling will ever do.",normal,ps4,2020-07-19,English,0,0,10,train

driew,"This game is excellent and really has it all; great storyline, great well-developed characters, and tight gameplay. It really pushed the video game medium forward and even though it was first released on the PS3 in 2013, it still holds up well today. I've finished this game twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times.,,You start off the game with Joel and his daughter Sarah who appear to be living normal lives before the outbreak. Unfortunately and heartbreakingly, Sarah dies and Joel becomes even more cynical than he already is. Fast forward 10+ years and Joel and his partner/friend Tess are now survivors of the outbreak who do various, sometimes questionable jobs to stay alive. They're now tasked with transporting a child, Ellie, for a group known as the Fireflies. You then find out that the reason they wanted to do this was because Ellie is the only known human who seems immune from the Infected so now Joel knows that he needs to bring Ellie to the Fireflies so they may find a cure for humanity.,,This game is bleak however it is offset by the rapport between Joel and Ellie who at first are strangers to one another but develop a father/daughter bond as time goes on. There is a message of hope in this game. Unlike the sequel, this game was not a slog to play through as it's nowhere near as bleak and doesn't suffer from the sequel's poor writing and plot holes.,,I would recommend this game to anyone unless they don't like third person shooters. The gameplay mechanics are good and fun but if I had to nitpick, I would say that your AI companion is pretty much invisible to enemies as they won't be alerted if they spot your ally. I understand why the developers were lazy and did this as it would be annoying if you were spotted every time your ally was seen however I would hope that if they did make a Part III (3; this is also present in Part 2 if you can believe it), they would rectify this.",normal,ps4,2020-07-17,English,0,0,10,train

AndyGarcia,"Este juego sin duda es una auténtica maravilla, no solo por los gráficos y su jugabilidad tan espectacular, sino por la forma en la que la historia es llevada a cabo a lo largo del mismo. A nivel gráfico, tanto en PS3 como en PS4 es sin duda un 10/10 teniendo en cuenta el año en el que salió a la venta. La forma tan fluida de controlar a los personajes te hace sentir parte de la historia, como si uno estuviera dentro del juego. Siguiendo con lo anterior, el hecho de fabricar objetos y mejorar las armas y habilidades le dan un plus para el entretenimiento del juego. Dándole en mi opinión un 10/10 de jugabilidad. Los personajes secundarios que te acompañan a lo largo de las misiones, si bien cumplen roles interesantes, podrían de ser un poco más útiles a lo largo de las batallas contra infectados o cazadores. Enfocando en lo anterior, Tess es sin duda quien más te ayuda cuando de esta se requiera en las peleas. Pasando a lo más importante del juego, la HISTORIA, esta es llevada a cabo de una forma espectacular, pudiendo ver a la perfección el desarrollo de los personajes principales y secundarios. La historia es tan atrapadora que cada vez que terminas una misión quieres saber más y más. El cariño que uno le toma a Joel y Ellie es tal que cuando termine el juego me dejo una sensación de vacío, como si hubiera perdido dos amigos que me acompañaron por tanto tiempo. Si le tuviera que dar una calificación al desarrollo de la historia, sin duda seria un 10/10.Para aquella persona que este leyendo esto, y no se haya comprado el juego aun, sin duda se lo recomiendo. No se va a arrepentir de haber comprado, para mi gusto, el MEJOR juego en la historia de la PS3 y por lo que veo hoy en día, también el mejor de PS4.

Llegara el punto en que empezaras a jugar con Abby y con ella pasaras al rededor de un 40% del juego, y este punto es totalmente nesesario para la historia ya que busca provarte el punto del juego dandote el pasado y los motivos de Abby mostrandotr que es un personaje que sufre y que tiene sus problemas y ademas que demuestra como el acto de amor del anterior juego de salvar a Ellie dejo fuertes repercuciones en Abby, y logra muy bien el echo de hacerte entender el personaje y hasta conectar con el, este juego te seguira llevando por diferentes momentos hasta el punto en que estaras en desacuerdo con el personaje de Ellie mostrandote como la venganza la consume h la lleva por un camino que le dejara fuertes cicatrices, ya que terminara con su redencion pero en un punto en que ya paga las consecuencias por tener el deseo de vengar a quien alguna vez fue lo mas parecido a un padre que pudo tener, por esto y mucho mas que solo se puede experimentar jugando esta obra de arte es que para mi es un 100/10 y vale mucho la pena jugarlo",normal,ps4,2020-07-11,Spanish,0,0,10,train

Kemp,"This game isn't perfect, but it does some things so much better than any other video game I've ever played that it feels like it might as well be perfect. Because of that, I can't give it anything less than a 10.,,First, my critiques. At times, the level design is extremely linear. I don't just mean that there's no open world. I'm fine with that. I just mean that there is almost no room for flexibility in how you approach most levels.,,My only other critique is that it could have been longer. I don't just mean that it should have been longer for the sake of being longer (it took me about 15 hours to complete). I mean there was actually quite a lot of room for more. For example, I won't spoil the narrative, but when you finish the sequence in Pittsburgh, they jump cut to Jackson. I understand why, but to me it felt like there was a chapter missing. There was room, I think, for a chapter with character development / emotional unpacking somewhere on the trek between Pittsburgh and Jackson. Similarly, after Jackson, I thought there was also some room for another chapter. I don't think these would have derailed the story. Rather, I think adding more could actually have served to build upon the character development and set up some of the games big moments even better.,,That said, there is a reason why so many people think this game is a masterpiece, including me. The writing is so much better than almost any game I've ever played. It is better than 9 out of 10 Hollywood movies. The characters are complex, their emotions feel natural, and you really can't help but become emotionally invested in Joel and Ellie and many others you meet along the way. The game is so grounded and somehow makes you forget this is a zombie video game. These characters feel so real.  Finally, this is all punctuated by an ending that truly is as good as everyone says it is. That's all I'll say about that. You just need to experience it.,,Also, as a bonus, the DLC is actually incredible. It retains all the writing and voice acting quality of the main game. It's an amazing story on its own, but it perfectly builds on the main game too. I really can't recommend this game enough. While there is somehow actually room for improvement, this game took my breath away. For that, it gets a 10/10.",normal,ps4,2020-07-07,English,2,1,10,train

SplitMind,"I came back to play this again recently after being disappointed in the sequel. I thought that perhaps the nostalgia had gotten to me and made me see the original as better than it was, however I was pleasantly surprised! So here is why I find this superior to its sequel.,,Firstly, the length. This game is significantly shorter and that is a very good thing. The shorter length means very little outstays its welcome and a quality over quantity approach. The adventure is concise and well timed.,,Secondly, the story. This ties in with the length, as being shorter means there was less padding out; the plot is very well paced and concise. In addition to this - it is a simpler plot and delivered in a simple manner without recurrent flashbacks. This does mean that the plot is a bit more basic, which was the curse of the sequel where it found itself in a minefield of dealing with sensitive character development. However I really like this simplicity; Ellie is your typical adolescent and I find her far more likeable as she grapples with her relationship with Joel.,,Thirdly, the environments, which are a bit more diverse than the sequel, which limited you to mainly urban dystopia. The original allows for nice visuals and backgrounds that are part of the journey and not just a flashback.,,However some aspects of the game definitely show their age. The gameplay is rather fundamental, similar to the early Nathan Drake games. The game is linear and comes across as more like an interactive movie at some points. The gunplay in particular seems to have a mind of its own. There is a lot of repetition but the variety of environments and shorter length prevent these from being as noticeable as they were in the sequel.,,Overall, this is definitely worth revisiting after having played the sequel, especially if you were disappointed. There are some aspects that have aged, and its rather worrying how little the sequel evolved these aspects given that there is a seven year gap between them.",normal,ps4,2020-07-06,English,0,0,8,train

Amuro_Rey,"For me, these are some must-haves (based on the hierarchy of importance) for a good game:,1. A good story (that makes you want to continue playing) - carries the most weight,2. Good gameplay that keeps the game exciting,3. Good music that sets the atmosphere and overall mood,And a distant 4th which is graphics... it can provide an overall believability & realness to the game but to be honest, I have enjoyed many games with lousy graphics.,So, for Last of Us all in all:,1. good (compelling story, relationship and emotions),2. good (nice survival feel),3. good (nice ambience, sounds),4. good (it looks too good to be a PS3 game),I do not generally like games with less than 50hrs play-time, not to mention the zombie genre. But Last of Us changed my perception greatly. Saying that it is a zombie genre does not do it justice, it is unique.

GameRogue,"A review for The Last of us Part 2 here instead of there cause you know …. Censorship and **** Its Great to see the gamming community finally united against toxic woke culture’s incursion in to our beloved gaming, metacritic has identified itself alongside its “critic reviewers” as no more than a fake review paid shill site that panders to business rather than upholding the idea of freedom of speech, undermining the idea of criticism entirely. All credibility for this site has just been beaten to death with a golf club. This type of review manipulation comes off as a very Chinese government thing to do, being ideologically aligned with the Chinese government renders metacritic by extension an arm of Chinese government policy and culture. Metacritic now offers a soft power way for the Chinese government to enforce its values of censorship and compliance on a supposedly free and liberal western society.  This is more than simple ‘manipulation’ it’s an act of ideological warfare, an act that will not go down when the free and liberal society remembers itself. With all credibility now gone, enjoy your decline metacritic…well until the Tencent money starts rolling in.

JayLando22,"I have not played it since it first came out and with some distance, I got to see how my feelings about the game have changed.,,At the time I thought the ending painted Joel as the anti-hero but playing it again in 2020 and watching the first ten minutes of that game I changed my feelings. The game tells a very simple ""Dad video game"" plot though very ahead of its time but might accidentally be saying something profound about the failure of systemic leadership.,,Anyway, the beginning really set up the ending but I am not sure if it is intentional because the writing in this game is so bad. I think at the time before Uncharted 4 I appreciated that they were trying to fix the ludo narrative dissonance by making everyone a murder sociopath in a murder world. Compared to Uncharted it seemed clever but ultimately it is pretty shallow.,,The audio and visuals still hold up. The guns sound good and the narrow corridor level design does look really nice, even if you can see its Crash Bandicoot roots.,,I liked it enough then, I still like it now, but other than all the time and money spent on the audio and visuals and animations and VO, it really never really rises as something special, just expensive.",normal,ps4,2020-07-02,English,1,0,6,train

Due_Offer,"Yes I know this review is seven years late but for a completely unrelated reason I thought I'd bob over here and post one. The game isn't complex (Start here, go there, stay alive), it's certainly not original (every bodies dead, two people meet, bad situation, bond), the game isn't long (can be done in two numb bums), seriously it's all been done before! It's even got glitches.,,What makes this one of the all time classics though is just how well every little insignificant moment keeps you invested. The charisma of the characters draws you in and every tidbit of new dialogue pulls you further in to the story. The environmental storytelling is well worth mentioning, I really felt for Ish and he's not even in the game! By design or possibly mistake the momentum and timing is kept just right to instantly sweep you up and keep you going throughout your entire play-through.,,Your invested in these characters every step of the way, so when something threatens them your going to do something about it. When they are separated you are going to bring them back together. When they are on their own your going to keep them safe. It's truly beautiful just how much you get to know and love your characters and personally feel what they are going through.,,I found I got more enjoyment out of the game the harder the difficulty. This isn't a shooter and it isn't a stealth game, it's an 'Oh my god we're going to die, do something!' kind of game. If you have enough ammo and resources are plentiful your on the wrong difficulty setting, trust me. Play the game as a coward, run away from hunters, avoid infected and scavenge like a hoarder.,,Combat can only be described as meaty, there's no glory in it, you only ever fight to stay alive. It's basic and it's brutal, exactly how it should be. Joel and Ellie swing wildly, shoot blindly and run for their lives most the time. You'll hear Ellie say that was intense on more than one occasion, you'll agree.,,I am of course making this review at a time when a lot of discussion is taking place about a game closely modelled on this one. I bought the original version on PS3, I bought the remaster same day as my PS4, it's seven years later and I'm still playing it. It's a powerful game and one I advise you to play yourself.

The detail and subtlety in the actions of the characters and the solemn beauty in the post-apocalyptic world are sublime.

These two elements help to immerse the player into the forlorn world in The Last of Us.,,The gameplay is solid with its satisfying gunplay and close-quarters combat, as well as the various puzzles littered throughout the game, help to keep the experience fresh. The switch to playing as Ellie from Joel further adds to the variety of gameplay.,,The story in The Last of Us has been compared to typical Hollywood post-apocalyptic stories and to a great degree it is, however, it is interesting enough that the stars of the game can carry it to greatness.,,What makes The Last of Us one of the greatest games of our generation is the relationship between Joel and Ellie. Witnessing their dynamic of survival grow to an intimacy reminiscent of father and daughter, speaks volumes of their humanity in a world where that is of scarcity. The interactions with other people along their journey, both the good and the bad, acted as the glue to hold them together and justifies their later actions from their perspective.,,The Last of Us is a timeless classic that teaches of the unbreakable bonds people can form even in the harshest of worlds; it is a cinematic experience that stirs all kinds of emotions in you that you'll fall in love with the journey time and time again.",normal,ps4,2020-06-30,English,1,1,9,train

tinyamricanflag,"I came back to play this one recently, before the sequel came out. It's still a great game, and the remaster definitely looks noticeable better than the PS3 original. The story, plot-wise is a fairly generic zombie post-apocalypse where the other survivors are more dangerous than the zombies. On the other hand, the characters and how they interact with each other and the world around them is what makes the games narrative special. Joel and Ellie's relationship is at the forefront of this and the writers did an amazing job with them. The voice acting for most of the characters is spot on. The game play is pretty good, not great. Its somewhat clunky and slow at times, especially during combat. After playing the sequel and its refinements to these systems, it felt so off and less intuitive in this one, but nothing deal breaking. This one may or may not be better than the sequel depending on several factors present in the sequel.

BigBoss2203,"The Last of Us is a masterpiece. Back when Naughty Dog knew what they were doing and could still write characters well, we got this game. The graphics still hold up very well, enemy design is creative. Gameplay is sort of standard, but is so polished to perfection that it always feels fluid.,The story is what sells it though. Along the way you will meet characters that are more than just bullet sponges there to die unceremoniously. They all display how 'normal' people might react when the world is ravaged by this infection, and all of them have small, but meaningful arcs that make them so memorable and impactful. I wish the sequel followed this example, and realised that it's easy to kill off people out of nowhere, but more important to make characters sympathetic and relatable, few moments made me as sad as the ending of 'summer'. The ending is an interesting dilemma, too. I believe it's a great reflection of Joel's arc and it made the journey more meaningful than the destination. Screw The Last of Us 2.

JaneyD,"Naughty Dog really nailed the perfect marriage of what makes a game great for me with Last of Us. A wonderful balance of sombreness and levity, action and stillness, ugliness and beauty. Super strong character development with the few characters who weren’t downright likeable and that had you heavily invested in keeping them alive, at least being intriguingly compelling and disturbingly human. Great graphics, solid movesets that cleverly changed with the characters requiring gamers to adapt, comfortably intuitive controls/menus, a good balance of led gameplay and really being able to take on the game in your own way and an absolutely stunning soundtrack made it a joy to play. My biggest complaint would be the ""ally"" AI which is always getting in the way or blocking where you are trying to go but my enjoyment of the rest of the game was such that I'm still willing to award top marks.

You can't enter rooms and just shooting everything that moves like Uncharted and it's a nice change : prepare yourself, craft Molotov cocktails and medikits, check your ammo and try to remain hidden until your ennemy walks into your trap.

By the gameplay side, people say that it is good but I think it is perfect. You can not expect more from survival game where you play as a character that is not a hero but just a simple guy. And I think that is the beauty of this game and story. You play as a Joel who is not like some superhero. He does not do anything good and bad at all just what he think is best and it show you that you can not always be a good guy because there is no such a person. This game hits you on your hearth and you will definitely play this more than once. Especially know that you know how to approach the game you can try hardest dificulty, The Grounded mode which is incredibly hard but instead of having bulletsponge on enemies or just other discusting thinks that other games do to harden your experience this game gives you less resources, you can be killed on two shots and you have no sonar. Just like in real life. And that is how you build a game around being so real that you just feel every inch, every breath, every word, every shot, every kill, every emotions.

DouchebagUncle,"I wasn't really interested in The Last of Us when it was released -I had never played a Naughty Dog game at the time- but I gave it a try and became my favorite PS3 exclusive. I played both the PS3 and PS4 versions but the latter is clearly superior with its glorious 1080p and 60 FPS and all DLCs included.,,I was invested in the story and Joel since the very beginning of the game and I really like both him and Ellie as characters. He is probably my favorite protagonist from any PlayStation exclusive. The narrative can be based on a cliche but the way Joel's father-daughter relationship with Ellie improves throughout the story is great. The cast is outstanding and at first I didn't even notice that Nolan North was in this.,,The gameplay is very good and I like the action or stealth approaches, the weapons and character upgrades and the real-time crafting system. I don't consider it a full survival horror game but some encounters can get really tense, specially on higher difficulties. The scarcity of ammo and resources on survivor or grounded mode forces you to approach most encounters with stealth and it's quite satisfying to choke every enemy one by one. However, shooting everybody with fully-upgraded weapons on NG+ is really fun. I noticed that some sections are so heavily scripted that you can sneak through everyone without killing them. The replayability is great thanks to the upgrades and the New Game+ and I ended up having nine playthroughs.,,It's a linear game but the scenarios in general are bigger than the ones in the first three Uncharted titles and encourages exploration to loot resources and ammo. I like reading some of the notes left by other survivors, particularly the story about Ish in the sewers.,,The visuals are amazing and it's one of the most realistic-looking games on PS3. Most scenarios are marvelous and the character models, lightning, attention to detail and motion capture are excellent. The tense atmosphere of the encounters with infected is well done, specially the ones at the University and the Underground Tunnel. The soundtrack is also amazing and it's easily one of the best on the console. I also like the fact that the Cordyceps infection is actually based on a real fungus that affects insects. The regular infected are generic but the creepy and unique clickers stole the show.,,The game's major flaw is by far the human enemies' A.I., which is really dumb. The infected are fine but the humans are beyond stupid. They seem to have a reduced field of view and won't hear when somebody is being choked to death behind them. Your companion can be loud and run right into the enemies and they won't react, but that would have made the game a lot harder. Also, the ""puzzles"" are way too easy and repetitive.,,I don't tend to play multiplayer modes but this one was surprisingly good. It's not purely focused on shooting like crazy and the matches consist of being stealthy and looting resources in order to craft items, buy upgrades and keep your clan healthy. I really enjoyed it and played way more than I could have expected. However, sometimes the matchmaking isn't fair and you end up against experienced players.,,The Left Behind DLC is okay but it's too short and one third of its duration are cutscenes. The sections in which you can force encounters between human enemies and infected are the best part of the DLC and is something that the base game should have had. It's not worth $10 on PS Store.,,The Last of Us is my favorite PS3 exclusive and was the best way to say goodbye to the console before the release of the PlayStation 4. So far, it has the best narrative in any Naughty Dog game, the graphics are top notch and the gameplay is great. I highly recommend it, preferably on PS4.",normal,ps4,2020-06-26,English,2,2,9,train

The relationship between Ellie and Joel is very well shown and their gradual strengthening of the relationship between each other is felt. The gameplay is very interesting, but the study of locations could be much better implemented. As for me, there is not enough of the oppressive atmosphere that is usually inherent in this genre. But for the interesting characters and the basic idea of a road adventure in the circle of the green zombie apocalypse, I can only thank Naughty Dog. The finale leaves with lumps in my throat and I really liked that I, as a player, were not given a choice at this moment, it should have been Joel’s decision, I’m just an outside observer.",normal,ps4,2020-06-25,English,0,0,8,test

I would find myself planning out how to do the next level as I was going through my day after a session.,,The graphics are also great, really pretty game.,,The music was not the best, in my view, but if I want good music I’ll buy an album. Specifically, I didn’t like their reliance on synthesizers that sounded like they came from the late 80’s. I didn’t think that mood paired well with the mellow electric guitar, which I really liked. But, again, if I want music, I don’t buy a video game—my opinion of the game’s music did not affect the score I’m giving the game.,,Now for the negatives (or, really, negative, because I really see only one). The story was dark, depressing, and without any redeeming value. I had hoped for some sort of lightness somewhere, anywhere, but I was disappointed. Playing this game after a hard day at work was like working a double shift, because I had to put my mind on so many sad things at the end of a long day. (For this reason, I finished the game and watched a movie of the DLC, simply because I didn’t want to put myself through any more of the same discomfort.),,It was entertaining from a superficial standpoint, but any thought of what the story means or any deep analysis of the story’s characters can only lead to man’s depravity, I think. I prefer to focus on happier things.

algal12,"Originally this game that Naughty Dog managed to create is one of the most exciting, emotional, spectacular games I've ever played. I don't know where to start. For the first time I tried it on the PS4, from the first playthrough I recognized the value and dedication it took to create this masterpiece.,First of all, the story. From the beginning to the end of your playthrough in the fantastic and hard world of The Last Of Us, you are called to handle a character that wins you over in the first half hour, makes you feel compassion and sadness. You bond so much that you place it as something more than just a simple character in a game! This magical journey that follows, your contact with NPCs, either allies or foes, gives you a different look at the people in that society and forms a new mentality with the actions and events that await you. Great importance is given to the father and daughter relationship (?) And moves a large percentage of players. By the end of the game, the emotional contact that will cause you is almost certain. A story of love and decisions that one would sow even for the risk of all humanity. Clearly 10/10,Then the graphics, in the world the company has given great attention to detail and it's as if nothing escaped them! For that time, the graphics were fantastic, and even now that I'm going through it again, I'm still shocked! Awesome cinematics and moments when you just leave the controller and sit with your mouth open looking at the screen. 10/10,Music, It is obvious that the composers experimented and produced a wonderful result that leaves pieces that give you a sense of exactly what is needed to accompany the story and each controversy. Even the home screen won me over so much that I just opened the game just to listen to the soundtrack while studying. 10/10,Gameplay. The game is enriched with many features in your character and with various options with which you can deal with any situation. It gives a very strong inventory and many creative ideas for new items that will take the combat to another level. However, it can be a bit complicated and difficult to handle. Sometimes there are repetitive movements and animations and friendly AI is as if it doesn't exist, other times you pass the enemy in front of your eyes and remain unnoticed. However, for me, these did not spoil the experience I had in the game 9/10,Apart from that, it is very likely that you will want to play the game again and again, whether it is for platinum or just to relive the experience (I finished it 7 times!). I would suggest pursuing Grounded (more difficult level) which is a very good challenge for the more experienced! It also has a very nice simple multiplayer that you split into three game modes which kept me going for hours with my friends being killed nonstop !,In summary, every PlayStation 4 (3) owner is required (if possible) to acquire and complete this flawless work of art. A story that will stay in your mind, characters that will make you feel compassion and deep love, graphics and cinematics that take your breath away! The best game I've ever played! Clearly 10/10!

lemon1921,"I love this game.  Yeah, sometimes the fighting or some missions can be a tad bit tedious. But the fantastic story and bond between Ellie and Joel really make up for it.  This game came out during the biggest fad of zombie media and I almost didn't get it because I was so over the zombie fad... but I'm so glad I did.

The story was gripping, the characters were well developed, the gameplay was tense and satisfying, the graphics were great, the music was somber. It was an absolute package. Overall, the story was relatively simple, but it was executed masterfully which resulted in its message being incredibly impactful. It was a game about survival and parenthood. It's theme is that parents are willing to do anything to protect their children. Even sacrifice the world. Honestly, this game and its legacy is sullied by its sequel, but I'd still certainly recommend playing it today.

У меня не было абсолютно никакого сопереживания главным героям, потому что я не чувствовал никакой реальной угрозы. Ну, просто какие-то боты их атакуют, вообще на них плевать, так же, как и на Джоэла. Да, мне плевать на него и мне не жалко, что его убили во второй части. С самого начала и до конца. В начале они убили какого-то Роберта. Что за роберт? Не понятно, сценаристы говорят ""а, плевать чо за Роберт. Вот он должен нашим ""героям"" пушки, поэтому он достоин смерти"". Во-первых, мне плевать на этого Роберта, во-вторых, кто он такой? Очередной бот. В-третьих, Джоэл и его подружка убили его, как сходили посрать. И После убийства Джоэл такой спокойно говорит ""что будем делать дальше?"", ну, реально, как-будто только что из толчка вышел. Человека убил.,Каннибалы-педофилы вообще притянутая за уши херня. Всю игру ""герои"" убивали безымянных картонных болванчиков, а потом нарисовались какие-то каннибалы. Как-будто сценаристы сказали друг другу ""Нам нужен напряжённый финал, о давайте каннибалов нарисуем из воздуха... ага, а еще пусть они будут педофилами. Да, давай."" И нюхнули очередную порцию коки. Бред. Вообще никаких эмоций не вызвали эти каннибалы.,И Третий пункт - это телепортирующаяся глаза Цикад, женщина с ранением в живот, которая магическим образом оказалась в больнцие раньше, наших героев. Бред.,Ну, про бредовый выбор Джоэла спасти Элли я даже писать не буду. В общем, игра на 6 из 10 максимум, и то не знаю, зачем я балл накинул, и не поставил 5 из 10, как совершенно средней, проходной игре.",normal,ps4,2020-06-22,Russian,0,0,6,train

squatchronson,"A true masterpiece of storytelling. The people review-bombing this clearly never understood the first game. Joel was never a good person, he was always somewhat despicable, yet he loved and protected those close to him. To the Fireflies, Joel was a heartless villain. And this game aims to address that. You spend the first half of the game despising Abby and her friends for killing Joel and then you go on a killing spree as Ellie, slaughtering these people you see as monsters. In the second half, you play from the other perspective, and come to love the characters you spent the first half of the game murdering. They are good people who do bad things, just as Ellie is a good person who does bad things. Both Ellie and Abby are out for vengeance over the death of a loved one. Both of them are simultaneously wrong and right all at the same time. The game forces you to come to grips with the fact that the NPCS in video games that you kill in cold blood, have people who love them. And to them YOU are the bad guy. It's a lot to handle, and I can't think of another example where it has been done before.

Willod,"Last Of Us'i hic begenmedim. Oyunu ilk 2018 de, ps4 umu alinca oynadim. Oyunu oyle ya da boyle bitirmis, o zaman da kotu oldugunu dusunmustum. Last Of Us Part 2 hype ina katilmak icin cikmadan bir ay once tekrar oynamaya karar verdigimde yine cok kotu bir oyun oldugunu dusundum ve ikinci oyunu ciktigi gibi oynamamaya karar verdim. Peki neden Last Of Us kotu oyun? Ben neden insanlarin yerlere goklere sigdiramadigi bu oyunu sevemiyorum?,Oynanis,İste butun olay burada. Bu oyunun oynanisi cok kotu ve sikici. Naughty Dog soyle bir sey yapmis; normalde olmasi gereken silah kullanma mekaniklerini daha kotu yapmis ve karakter gelisimiyle onlari olmasi gereken hale getirmenizi istemis. Soyle ki; oyunun basinda nisan aldiginizda imlec o kadar sallaniyor ki siz imleci hedefe dogrultmaya calisirken imlec tam tersi yonde gidiyor. Nisan almak icin L2 ye bastigimda imlecin baslangic noktasi o kadar sacma sapan yerlerde oluyor ki nisan almak iyice eziyet haline donusuyor. İmlecin odaklandiginda capinin kuculmesinin zamanlamasi cok sacma anlarda oluyor ornegin ben daha imleci adamin vucuduna dogru kaydirirken odaklanmis oluyor adamin vucuduna getirdigimdeyse odak kayboluyor. Normalde soyle olmasi gerekmiyor mu: ben bir noktaya nisan aldigimda once karakter odaklanir ve imlec kuculur eger cok uzun sure ayni noktada tutarsam imleci bu sefer odak kaybolur ve imlec buyur ve ben ates ettigimde tutturma ihtimalim azalir. İste Last Of Us ates etme mekaniklerini en basindan olmasi gerektigi gibi yapmayip karakter gelisimiyle olmasi gereken hale getirilmesini istemis ve bu oynanisa zenginlik katmamis aksine oynanisin sig olmasina ve oyundan alinabilecek zevkin baltalanmasina sebep olmus.,Oynanisin bir diger elementi olan gizlilik ise comel, arkadan yaklas ve hakla, dikkat dagitmak icin saga sola tas at, sise at gibi elementlerden olusuyor. Buradaki sorun ise karaktere arkadan yaklasip bogmaya kalktiginizda olan animasyonun sacma sapan uzunlugu ve bu olay oyunun icinde o kadar cok tekrar ediyor ki o animasyonun uzunlugu insani cileden cikartiyor. Gizlilikte dusman yapay zekasi ise yapay zeka gibi hissettirmiyor. Cunku bir karakteri gizlilikle oldurdugunuzde bir anda herkes sizin oldugunuz yere dogru yurumeye basliyor ve catismaya girmek kacinilmaz hale geliyor. Bu da gizlilikle ilerlemenin yalnizca vakit kaybi gibi hissettiriyor. Ancak catisarak ilerlediginizde ise cok fazla kaynak tukettiginiz icin ve oyunda butun malzemeler sayili oldugu icin oyun size bir nevi gizliligi zorunlu kiliyor. Ayrica bu gizlilik ve aksiyon kisimlari oyunun basindan sonuna ayni hicbir degisim gelisim yok. Oyunun en basinda ne yapiyorsaniz oyunun sonunda da onu yapiyorsunuz.,Bu olay karakter gelisimi icin de gecerli. Mekaniksel olarak karakterinizin oyunun basinda sahip oldugu ozelliklerini iyilestiriyorsunuz; daha iyi nisan alma, dusmanlarin seslerini daha uzaktan duyabilme, daha cok can vs. Yani oyun size hicbir yenilik sunmuyor. Nasil basliyorsaniz o sekilde bitiriyorsunuz.,Bu oyunda level design diye bir sey yok. Oyunda catismalarin gectigi mekanlarda fazladan en fazla bir ya da iki oda oluyor. Girdiginiz binalar hic dusunulmeden tasarlanmis dumduz yapilar. Oyun cizgisel oldugu icin diyebilirsiniz. Ancak alternatif rotalar olabilirdi.Oyunda gidecegim yere farkli odalardan gecerek ya da butun binayi cevreyi kesfederek gidebilirdim. Ancak kesfedebileceginiz alanlar cok kisitli ya da kesif gudusunu tamamiyle tatmin eden ya da tetikleyen bir yani yok. Kesfetmeyi yalnizca mecbur kaldiginiz icin yapiyorsunuz. Yakin dovusu oyun size son care olarak sunmus. Gizlilikle ve silahla oldurdugunuz dusmanlarin arasindan biri siyrilip size yaklasirsa onu yakin dovusle alabilin diye sunulmus. Burda da elinizde sopa olusunun demir olusunun ya da baska bir yakin dovus silahi olusunun hicbir onemi yok. Her birinin uzerinde kullanim bari var. Neredeyse her biriyle yalnizca bir dusmani oldurebiliyorsunuz. Ayrica yakin dovusle birini oldurmek cok uzun suruyor.,Ayrica bulmacalar berbat. Bir de kare tusunu spamlama var. Bir dusmanla bogusurken oyun size kare spamlatiyor. Bir de bu oyunda 4 tane falan dusman tipi var herhalde.,Hikaye,Hikayenin tek guzel yani sonu. Onun disinda ovulecek bir yani varmis gibi gelmiyor. Ellie ve Joel arasindaki baba-kiz iliskisinin yolculuk boyunca ilerlemesini bekliyorsunuz ancak yol boyunca Joel sen benim kizim degilsin tavirlari takinirken bir anda degisiyor. Yani tek bir olayla bu iliski kuruluyor. Dolayisiyla o samimiyeti bir turlu yakalmiyorsunuz. En azindan ben yakalayamadim. Yalnizca oyunun sonunda Joel'in verdigi karar beni etkiledi.,Sonuc olarak oyunun ne hikayesi beni etkiledi ne de karakterleri bana kendisini cok onemsetebildi. Sikici bir oynanisla da oyun bana giderek kendisini onemsiz hale getirdi.",normal,ps4,2020-06-21,Turkish,3,2,4,train

LizzieRusso,"My actual favourite game of all time. I may be a bit biased though, since I played this when I was a newbie to games and loved it then. But since then the love for it has stuck with me. Can't express how amazing every single thing about this game is.,The soundtrack is beautiful and at times heart wrenching.,The zombies aren't just mindless hordes out to kill you and are actually scary.,The plot of the game is pretty straightforward but so well done it leaves a mark on you.,Most of all, the characters which are what really made this game for me. Tess, Bill, Marlene all of them had motivations that made their character arcs sensible and them as characters feel like real ppl. And the crown jewel of the game, Joel and Ellie and their amazing relationship that we get to see progress from distant travellers to a father - daughter dynamic to the point where Joel kills almost an entire hospital full of Fireflies to save Ellie. The ending is such a well done gray the choice that doesn't end up feeling dis satisfactory which many art forms struggle with.",normal,ps4,2020-06-20,English,0,0,10,test

JFeixasNix,"By no means a masterpiece or excellent. Just a good game, nothing more. Very overhyped.,If you played lots and lots of great games you would realise this is nothing special at all. Lots of things can be improved, starting with the character movement and control, which is lackuster. The AI of the enemies is downright awful, and lots of programming errors. The melee combat is terrible, lacks basic things like parry and counter, which is non-existent. Once the enemy gets near enough to you, it grabs you and you can do absolutely nothing, which is very frustrating and very fake.,Some weapons are under-powered (guns) that you need 4 shoots sometimes to kill enemies and some are overpowered (bow) which can kill enemies in one shoot. I mean, really?,The story is also nowhere near as being as good as some claim. it lacks a lot of depth and has a lot of incongruences.,A very good idea of a game that has some good parts, but overall could have been better executed.,I'd take Uncharted 2 from ND over this any day of the week.",normal,ps4,2020-06-20,English,0,0,6,train

Я поглядел часть прохождения на Youtube!,Так, что когда проходил её уже на PS4, впечатления были смазаны.,Я не скажу, что это, прям, идеальная игра, но одна из лучших за всю историю игростроя, это точно!,Начну с похвалы.,Графика. Я не знаю, как разработчики выжали из чахлого нутра PS3, такую картинку, но факт остаётся фактом, игра выглядит превосходно!,Сюжет. Ну, на мой взгляд, лучшего сюжета я не припомню. Снять фильм по игре можно на раз, менять в сценарии ничего не придется! Многим фильмам, расти и расти до таких высот. Просто сногшибающее начало, как ни странно, поддерживается буквально до финальных титров и не провисает!,Боевая система, просто на высоте. Опыт Uncharted, не прошел даром. Стрелять интересно. И ближний бой не подкачал!,Прокачка персонажа и оружия, интересная и не замороченная. Кстати, до конца игры ты, во что то вкачиваешся, тебе, что то нужно, в отличии от большенства игр, где прокачиваться перестаёшь уже к середине игры. Или не за чем, или не во что.,Лицевая анимация, великолепна! Жаль только, что внешность Элли Уильямс заменили прямо перед релизом. Лицо Эллен Пейдж, мне больше нравилось, хотя, как оказалось, к игре она отношения не имела.,Ну, конечно, всё это окружала, просто фантастическая атмосфера. С персонажами, буквально, сживаешься!,После всего сказанного, даже не знаю, почему игра мне показалась не идеальной. Наверное из-за дополнения Left Behind. Оно испортило всё идеальное ощущение от игры. Ведь надо же было, напоследок насрать в идеальную кашу игры, своей педарестической желчью. Кому вы сделали лучше? Трансвеститам и гомосексуалистам?

I was so tired of the screen going black and then seeing hulk hogan still standing there in 3rd person. Let me play as ELLIE the character I have bonded with.

ClubPS,"Naughty Dog cerró la generación de PlayStation 3 con esta increíble joya del gaming y sin duda y al carecer de Retrocompatibilidad la PlayStation 4, era necesario un Remastered que sacará todo el potencial de la obra de Naughty Dog.,Gráficos.,Sin duda el título explotó el poder de PlayStation 3 al máximo tan es así que incluso en la versión de PlayStation 4 no le pide nada a los juegos de la actual, sin duda su apartado gráfico es maravilloso sumado a un diseño de arte espectacular, dónde cada lugar cuenta una historia sólo con miralo.,Los modelados de los personajes te sorprenderán muchísimo, desde los principales hasta los infectados lucen increíblemente y sorprende más saber que esto viene de una generación pasada.,Sonido.,Todo, desde la banda Sonora hasta los sonidos ambientales están perfectamente equilibrados para meterte de lleno a la experiencia de un mundo post apocalíptico. La música del compositor Argentino Gustavo Santaolalla es perfecta y no se podía esperar menos de un hombre que tiene premios tras de si como los Oscares.,El doblaje en el cual mi caso lo tengo en Español de España es bastante aceptable sin embargo es mucho mejor escuchar el doblaje en su idioma original.,Duración.,The Last of Us es un juego cuya duración es muy variable, dónde te lo puedes pasar en una sentada si decides ir en modo fácil o llevarte varias semanas si decides ir por el camino del modo Encallado o Realista, lo cierto es que el título en su modo historia tiene mucho por explorar si es que eres de esos amantes a encontrar todos los coleccionables, además su excelente historia te hará mucho más ameno rejugarlo.,Dentro del Remastered encontramos el DLC ""Left Behind"" una parte extra de la historia donde jugaremos con Ellie en un tiempo antes de conocer a Joel y al igual que el modo historia su duración va a depender de en que modo decidas pasarlo, además de que su historia nos mostrará un poco más de la personalidad de Ellie.,Multijugador, así es, The Last of Us tiene un multijugador que a la fecha sigue muy activo, el modo facciones es algo que sin duda es muy diferente a cualquier multijugador que hayas probado antes, ya que no es el típico juego de salir a disparar a lo primero que se te ponga en frente, ya que esa es la pero estrategia en este juego. Además de que el juego tiene un retroceso en sus armas demasiado exagerado lo que hace que salir a lo rambo sea una tarea además de difícil, inútil. Podrás pasar días en este multijugador.,Historia.,Muchos podrán decir que la historia de The Last of Us es el típico cliché del cine de ""zombies"", sin embargo Naughty Dog hizo un estupendo trabajo trabajando no sólo el panorama general del juego, si no trabajando a cada uno de sus personajes otorgándoles algo que muy pocos juegos o incluso películas, personalidad a cada uno de sus personajes, todo lo que verás en esta historia se sentirá tan natural como la vida misma. Prepara tus pañuelos porqué el juego te podrá sacar una lágrima de un momento a otro.,Gameplay.,El juego tiene una grandiosa mezcla de diferentes géneros, shooter en tercera persona, sigilo, crafteo, exploración, terror y aventura. Toda esta amalgama de experiencias le da al título la oportunidad de poderte pasar sus diferentes zonas de muchas y varias formas, podrás pasar la zona disparando, si es que tienes las balas claro está o bien podrías pasarla sin disparar e incluso sin matar a un solo enemigo, así de genial es el gameplay y sus opciones. Sin duda toda una joya.,,Conclusión:,Un juego que debe estar en tu colección si o si, una joya del gaming en general y no sólo de PlayStation, no por nada tiene más de 200 Premios GOTY en su currículo.",normal,ps4,2020-06-17,Spanish,0,0,10,train

Ukropgreen,"С момента релиза прошло уже 7 лет. За это время я успел пройти игру трижды: сначала на PS3 в русском дубляже, потом на PS4 Pro в оригинальной английской озвучке и третий раз буквально на днях, чтобы освежить в памяти основной сюжет и ряд мелочей связанных с ним. И каждый раз, проходя игру, ловил себя на мысли, что TLOU является прекрасной самодостаточной игрой. Это история не столько про зомби и постапокалипсис, как про людей и их человеческие качества. Здесь поднимается и проблематика маленького человека в большом жестоком мире; и классическая философская ""проблема вагонетки"" Филиппы Фут; и взаимоотношения отцов и детей. Что касается геймплея, то конечно таскать лестницы в 2020 уже не так весело, как в 2013, но благодаря тому, что игра вышла крайне цельной и сбалансированной, записывать это в минус игре я не буду.

The game is great with solid game-play mechanics, beautiful visuals, well made set pieces and amazing writing. The characters are grounded and relatable without Joel, the main character being just some generic dude with a gun.  The game is one massive escort mission but the fact that it is one isn't even noticed by the player as it doesn't feel like one, Ellie is useful and doesn't actually do anything harmful to the player like in Resident Evil 4.,There is some amazing visual storytelling much like Bioshock but unlike Bioshock all of it must be found by the player through notes and audio diaries that are found in totally out there locations. Bioshock has that kind of thing only it is far harder for the player to miss those audio logs as they glow and whatnot. Furthermore, the Last of Us has crafting mechanics using everyday items found throughout the post-apocalyptic US landscape. The game's story also never gets boring, it is perfectly paced so that the player never gets bored by the plot or game-play which is something other PlayStation exclusives cannot say. Overall the game is fantastic and a definite must play but if you don't have a PS3 or PS4 there are many great lets-plays out there on YouTube.  There is a lot Naughty Dog must live up to for the second game so here's hoping they can match it or exceed it in quality.",normal,ps4,2020-05-24,English,1,1,10,train

Its structure and gameplay ties the narrative into a beautifully built world with high levels of detail, perfect sound design and lighting. The Remaster takes the original game, and enhances it for PS4. Making the framerate cap a solid 60FPS and 1080p+ resolutions. The motion capture in this game is perfect, with an excellent cast of actors and actresses, including Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.

The one scene with Ellie and Joel discussing Loss after she ran away always bring droplets to my eyes. The game has a way of building and staying true to the characters. Joel is a wonderful character that grows through the game with his connection with other characters. The decision that he makes at the end of the game u feel the hardship of doing it as your forced to kill but you feel why he did it as you see what had him make these choices through his journey. Ellie amazing as she goes through the struggle of growing up through the apocalyptic world wondering how the world used to be. Through the game you see the bad of the world but u also get a sense of hope as these character discuss how Joel might teach Ellie how to play the guitar and how he was when he young.

A lot of people online were saying that it's the controller that does that, but I've had no similar issue with any other game and I read that a lot of ppl experienced the same thing. I would rate this as a 9.5 out of 10 just for that because 9 feels too low for this game.

sebastianali,"Mientras que no jugué a la versión original de PS3, bastara con reseñar el remaster de PS4. Ahora bien, The Last Of Us Remastered es un buen videojuego en si? Bueno, voy paso por paso...,-Gráficos: Como todos los juegos de Naughty Dog, los gráficos son increíbles para la época y envejecieron muy bien, no tienen nada que envidiarle a los PC de aquella época (2013). Sin embargo, al igual que el Uncharted, esto corre a costa de tener mapas chicos.,-Jugabilidad: Hmmm, creo que esta es la razón por la que le doy un 7... Si bien va evolucionando conforme vas avanzando y me gusta, es bastante mediocre... Al principio estas muy indefenso y los zombis te hacen mucho daño, en especial los chasqueadores... El juego requiere mucho ensayo y error, y es muy facil morir... Así se hace frustrante y aburrido... Yo creo que el problema con este juego es el haber combinado la jugabilidad del survival horror con el de sigilo. Ademas de estar muy poco aprovechado el crafteo, ya que de todas formas los objetos se consiguen normalmente y... tampoco hay mucho que conseguir, cosa que es una pena, ya que hay mucho potencial desperdiciado en la jugabilidad... Luego podes mejorar las armas y vas consiguiendo mas, cosa que esta bastante bien, pero nada mas... El combate suele ser bastante frustrante, y los enemigos son esponjas de balas. Se supone que hay que acercarse con sigilo, pero no debería obligarte a hacerlo todo el tiempo. Te pasas mas de la mitad del tiempo agachado. Igualmente, una vez que pasas por alto todos estos detalles y avanzas bastante en el juego, conseguís mejores armas para defenderte mejor y se podría decir que jugablemente zafa. Ademas, mientras vas avanzando en el juego, también conseguís dinero. Este puede servir para desbloquear extras ya sea skins, arte conceptual, etc. Parecido a Uncharted. Me gusta, ya que aumenta la rejugabilidad y te da la oportunidad de revivir los mismos escenarios que te gustan, mientras desbloqueas nuevo contenido. Rabian que uno de los trajes es de Jak And Daxter? Genial! Naughty Dog siempre hizo referencias en sus juegos a otras franquicias suyas...,-Historia: Junto con los gráficos, este es su punto mas fuerte. No haré spoilers, pero solo puedo decir que ese toque de película, mas la relación entre Ellie y Joel que se va desarrollando a lo largo del trayecto, son simplemente sobresalientes... La historia te atrapa, y si bien no la puedo detallar ya que es muy larga, cualquiera que lea esta reseña seguramente sabrá de que se trata y estará de acuerdo conmigo en que la historia es simplemente excelente. La muerte de Sarah.... ufff, todavía no supero eso ;(,-Conclusión: Los puntos positivos de este juego son muy fuertes! Lo puedo recomendar? Claro que si! Jugablemente es mediocre, pero las cinemáticas compensan ese esfuerzo y el modo multijugador es bastante divertido... Ademas de que si ustedes no son como yo que prefiero jugabilidad sobre historia, déjame decirte que pasaras un muy buen rato. La manera de contarte la historia es digna de una película, no es broma, y en parte el juego es rejugable, por lo que no es malo. Un 7 es una muy buena nota. Preferiré Uncharted, pero The Last Of Us tiene su nicho de jugadores y eso hay que respetarlo. A pesar de sus fallos me la pase muy bien.",normal,ps4,2020-04-12,Spanish,3,2,7,train

psylife,"The first thing to note is that the game is surprinsingly short (Hard playthrough) - The absence of uniquely crafted set pieces points towards the fact that the game might have had a lower budget than previous naughty dog productions. Gameplay wise, you are looking at a competent stealth action game, but that does nothing new to advance the genre.,,Let's be clear, as far as stealth options are concerned, you get to chose between throwing a brick, or a bottle, that's it. There are no exciting environmental opportunities to leverage, no interesting situational obstacles to deal with, and boredom sets in as, you deal with fairly identical situations, over, and over. Think of Uncharted, with extra boring interruptions, walking sections, and with the fun action bits removed. They also got rid of the puzzles too since you now get to play with bricks and ladders.,,The crafting and looting is competently handled, but there is really nothing in terms of gadgets or skill tree worth praising above and beyond the competition.,,And that's my problem, in the light of all of these observations, it is difficult for me to accept the praise the game has garnered. Maybe an exceptional scenario and plot could have justified the praises, but considering how cliche and predictable the story is, it is that much more difficult to reconcile myself with its critical success.,,Yes, the acting, music, presentation and production value is a cut above the competition, but as far as 2013 release games, I can think of so many games that easily outclass The last of us in terms of game and level design, pacing, mechanics, and player agency. Games such as Tomb raider, Blacklist, GTAV, not only do more, but they do it better - and if we wanted to draw a comparison with a game that more closely resembles the last of us, Spec ops: The line is the more successful of the two in realizing both its game-play and story-telling ambitions.,,The last of us remains a moderately enjoyable game, it does have a few saving graces in terms of scenario and game-play (like the hunting sandbox at the beginning of the winter chapter), but it is far too repetitive and limited in scope to be considered anything above the best the competition has to offer. It is also worth noting that 2 of Resident evil 4's most memorable, fun, and iconic game-play moments were ""borrowed"" by Naughty dog, though not as well executed as in Capcom's masterwork.,,As a videogame, The last of us only truly excels at mimicking what has previously been done better on film and TV, yet does very little in terms of intelligent design, and interactive story telling.",normal,ps4,2020-04-01,English,1,1,6,train

The story is amazing, the characters feel so real, and I love the soundtrack. The game is so immersive remember the part where Joel gets separated from Ellie and has to find a key card to unlock a door by turning in a generator and it alerts a bunch of zombies I got so immersed in that part I actually had to use the washroom after because of how scared I got or how sometimes I would get worried when I was low on ammo and had to use creative stealth strategies since I suck at being stealthy In games. Another reason I love this game is because of the characters and how they show real emotions and get closer as the story progresses. That’s another thing I like it’s a mainly story based game I’m not a fan of backtracking and it’s why I don’t really like side missions with some games I’m fine with them but others I just don’t like it.

The opponents are stupid and you always do the same thing.,expanded,ps4,2020-02-28,English,5,1,1,train
Mamacoca,I've always heard good things about this game. The graphics are beautiful and look very realistic. Gameplay is fun and really keeps you on your toes.

death12123,"Such a good game but it's ruined by it's controls. One thing is that the story is top tier. It's one of the best I've ever played. Gameplay is good and I understand the feel. Some things could've been better but the thing that kills it for me is the sensitivity. I maxed out the sensitivity and it's STILL unbearably slow. Keep in mind on PC I play at 3200 DPI and on games like COD on console at Insane setting. For story node the slow sensitivity is fine but for Online it's unplayable. I mean you have enemies coming from the back and you turn as slow as the hour moves on the clock. If it wasn't for this I'd easily give this game a 10. Story and the game are beautiful nontheless. Online and the sensitivity on the other hand? Not good at all. That's one problem with consoles though. As much as I love it, if the settings only allow a certain thing, that's all you get. If anything they should allow custom settings to your hearts content on TLOU2 or atleast way higher sensitivity than what feels like a 4 out of 10 on other games.",normal,ps4,2020-02-11,English,0,0,9,train

A trama de Joel e Ellie é sensacional junto com o que vai acontecendo na relação deles e de todos que aparecem na volta deles.,,A gameplay é: MEU DEUS, QUE GAMEPLAY ÉPICA. Sério! é muito boa a jogabilidade de TLOU. A jogabilidade (exremamente boa) é acompanhado por um sistema de combate corpo a corpo magnifica! os golpes e movimentos são muito, mas MUITO bem feitos.,,Em The Last of Us tem um como você melhorar suas armas, e com direito a uma variação excelente de armas. Como pistolas, revólvers, fuzis, escopetas, arco e flechas, lança-chamas, tijolos, garrafas, facas e muito mais.,,Os coletáveis em TLOU são ótimos porque alguns mostra como o mundo era antes do vírus acontecer, e você conhece um pouco das história de alguns personagens.,,Agora, no PlayStation 4, temos uma reolução muito mais alta (chegando até o 4K) e jogamos o jogo inteiro à 60 FPS! agora a jogabilidade fica melhor ainda do que já era, e com gráficos maravilhosos.,,Multiplayer -,TLOU é um jogo completo! e teve direito a um Multiplayer incrível com muitos players ativos até hoje. Imagina todas essas variações de armas e aquela jogabilidade excelente que falei, porém agora contra outros players... Fica divertido, frenético e emocionante demais. Agora podemos ter muita mais noção de jogo devido ao maravilhoso 60 FPS e, isso, ajuda demais em combates com armas ou corpo-a-corpo.,,O único ponto negativo que tenho dar ao Multiplayer (Além de ele ter sido fechado) é o fato dele não ter várações de modos de jogo. Você poder jogar o modo ""Sobrevivente"" e o modo ""Suprimentos"", que basicamente um é mata-mata e o outro é o mesmo, porém, sem respawn.,,TLOU é uma obra de arte e merece todo carinho, atenção e admiração por ele.

No es que sea mala, es que es muy lenta. Demasiado algunas veces, ya que en determinado punto puedes jugar 2 horas seguidas sin que ocurra algo interesante, y centrándote en caminar y disparar un par de veces solo para volver a caminar.,,Habiendo aclarado eso, debo decir que todo lo demás es genial. Tanto si controlamos a Joel como a Ellie, el Gameplay tan preciso del juego nos crea una experiencia muy inmersiva. No es un juego de acción, no es un juego de disparos, no es un juego de zombies. La cuestión va mucho más allá, creando una narrativa completa acerca de la soledad y el miedo a la misma.,,La historia tampoco es precisamente nueva, pero lo importante aquí es el story telling en que está contada: es maravilloso.,,GRÁFICOS:,Simplemente impresionante. Me cuesta trabajo creer que es un remaster lanzado en 2014 porque luce increíble. Cada escenario del juego, personaje y arma.,Las cinemáticas son igualmente impresionantes de lo realistas que lucen, las expresiones faciales de cada personaje hablan por sí mismas, resaltando la importancia de los desarrolladores de crear no solo un videojuego sino una experiencia cineasta.,,SONIDO:,Tanto el soundtrack como los efectos de sonido son muy buenos, incluso los momentos de silencio total están bien implementados. De la mano de los gráficos y el estilo hiperrealista de arte, N.D. ha logrado concebir una inmersión poco común en los videojuegos.,,INNOVACIÓN:,Todo está en punto.

Very good looking locations, enviroments and all. I believed that this is how apocalpytic world could look like. Now for the biggest con of this game for me and why i gave it only 1/10. The combat and hardest difficulty (which i played on). First of all its **** insane how many bugs are in this game mostly in combat, how the game manages to bug itself so many times in such a different ways its beyond me that this is triple A game and even REMASTERED one. The game has no potential to be that hard like on the hardest diff. They just put it here for fun. The character u are moving is ultra clunky. The enemies dont even need to hit u. If u are too close to the enemy and he ends his attacking animation and doesnt hit u, dying animation still starts and u just die. The mob didnt had to hit u u just had to be in some **** magical area around this mob while he ends his attacking animation and thats it. U ARE DEAD. 0 precision. 0 potential for this game to be that hard. If u cant make game with fair combat that is polished in some basic level then dont put this hard diff into the game. Another thing is that in some areas zombies are just stupid **** mobs. In some areas they are hiding from u and runninng away from u like they had an AI upgrade while i wasnt watching. Also another thing is that in the first 3 hours of the game there are no zombies in the game at all.

Jam0_,"This is one the of the greatest games ever created. I played and finished this game three times. This story rich third-person shooter has some of the best gameplay, graphics, sound and lighting I have ever seen in any video game. The story captivates the player and does what every good writer attempts to do get the player to have a vested interest in the characters and their world. Not only is the story written extremely well but the gameplay is crafted in a way that everyone can enjoy. It's intense and has just enough gore to keep anyone involved in the action. The action also isn't overly unnecessary and is used carefully throughout the game even though it is one of the main components. The lighting and sound design are used in such a way that intense moments are truly intense and scary moments did make me scared. Most importantly moments of hate, love and laughter were also crafted perfectly. However, this game lacks in multiplayer. Bare in mind I went into this game with the sole purpose of playing the story so I wasn't that bothered by the multiplayer. The multiplayer while challenging and creative it lacks fun. Leveling and unlocks, in my opinion, take way too long and the unchanged combat from the story can be tedious when playing online in a competitive setting. I hope to see more coop multiplayer options in The Last of Us 2.,,Overall this has got to be one of my favourite games of all time.

KeeganGatward,"In light of the prequel to this MASTERPIECE coming end of May 2020, I thought I'd share my thoughts on the first game...,I have been a gamer for many years now, and I still cannot think of a game that has captivated me in the way that The Last of Us has. Let's establish this...ever since this game was released, I have played it countless times. For a game that was made during the end of the PS3 life-cycle, it's gameplay mechanics and visuals are simply amazing! You really feel the continuous sense of dread of whatever enemy type is thrown at you through the limited ammo and resources; even through the carefully crafted landscape. I can't recall any other time where I was happy to have found a small bag of fertiliser.,I could rant forever about the characters and the story...needless to say that the amazing team at Naughty Dog are wizards! In the standard 15 hour run-time, you walk away as if you have made two life-long friends; Joel and Ellie. Whilst you are repulsed by the things they do (which is the entire point), you can't help but feel relieved that Joel and Ellie are the champs that walk out of the situation; regardless of how many ethical lines crossed.

They are both trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world we’re an infected outbreak has gone loose. The game shows you how these two people are becoming closer together. The outbreak is also a more grounded take on a zombie out break, instead of just being zombies, they are now infected by a fungus type infection called the cordyceps. This game brings a lot of strategy to the standard bet em up/shooter genre. It brings in elements of survival gameplay with limited resources and ammo. This forces you to do stealth which is hard in its own way.,The music is very mellow but complements the story and gameplay. It was very well done by gustavo santaolalla.,The game is a refreshing spin on the zombie and post apocalyptic formula we have become so a costumed to today.

MEMESAREPEOPLE,"I initially thought The Last of Us was just another zombie game with a lackluster story and gameplay. That’s what the game wants you to think. Once I delved deeper into the game, it was unlike anything I have ever played. The story had a lot of emotional moments, and those truly felt real due to the perfect writing and voice acting. The emotional moments didn’t distract the fact that there is still a compelling story underneath it. The gameplay is demanding and difficult, and it won’t hold your hand, due to dwindling supplies, smart enemies, and a true sense of dread during every encounter, makes every combat scenario dynamic and fun. The crafting system is simple, but requires you to make tough decisions on the fly that will affect what the outcome of a different encounter might be. For example, should you craft a medkit, or a molotov? Should you craft a shiv, or a bomb? Not only does the remastered version have the full single player with 60 fps high quality graphics and lighting, but also contains a unique and fun multiplayer to boot. Not only that, the excellent DLC, Left Behind is included as well, providing a different story about Ellie, and providing a different perspective of the zombie infected world.

Even though I played it under not ideal circumstances.I was like in a sort of cryogeny for like 10 20 years without gaming and then all of a sudden I had the time and spare cash to buy games and a console. I got my PS4 around the time the Pro launched. I didn't know Naughty Dog. After hearing excellent things about Uncharted I got intoit. I played it on baby mode with auto-aim on. I had a blast. I saw TLOU on sale many times and all the buzz aabout it but I didn't get into it. After playing Uncharted 4, I learned TLOU was also from ND. I got excited and waited for a chance to play TLOU. Eventually I got that. So, I expected something like what I had with Uncharted 4 , like I would just sit back and enjoy the ride. And then I was like, what? I guess if English was my mother tongue I'd definitely say something like F---. The setting was so tense, people were evil and then there weree those monsters, they were just horrifying. Man, I couldn't expect that from ND, such a distinct game. I was confident it would be another cake walk like U4 but it wasn't. And before, I mainly played RPGs. So, I was bad really at aiming and in TLOU being a survival game your ammo is limited and it's harder to aim, because your arm swings. And then there were those creatures, those things. Man, my first encounter with a clicker, I just kept dying and dying, I was like F---. I'm very weak, and at that point I couldn't stand anything horror related, and after dying so many times to that clicker, I was just so scared that I couldn't fight it anymore so I just startred running around and eventually by running around I figured hoew to beat that level, not the bestest of solutions but it worked. I'd say that this was my tougest moment in the game, there are worse monsters through the game but I guess this is what people call learning curve. Yeah, those clickers are unlike anything I've ever seen. Normally I'd put down such a game for being too scary, but now being not so young anymoire I felt I couldn't put it down. That was great because after playing TLOU I feel that my life is now divided between Before TLOU and After TLOU. After TLOU is awesome, because now I can play horror games, in fact I've played 2 in a row: Prey and Alien Isolation. Never thought I'd get into these types of games. So, thank you very much ND!

(Crafting, limited supplies, stealth),Setting and world-building are both fantastic and very immersive.,Strong characters and voice acting.,Story and Storytelling are expertly done through many means but one of my favourites is the use of multiple playable characters at poignant moments to emphasise what the character is feeling and put the player in their shoes.,Technical masterpiece especially considering the hardware it released on.,The weapons feel great.,,Joel should move faster. His animations, on the whole, are a little slow and clunky feeling in the pursuit of realism. This is only a problem once you lose stealth and a fight breaks out. The feeling of having multiple enemies from different directions often feels overwhelming because of his slower movement in combat.,,AI companions can break immersion by not being detected when they move poorly and sometimes feel as if they get in the way but is counteracted by how awesome it feels when Ellie does genuinely help you out in a fight and it beats the alternative of having them get spotted by enemy AI when their pathing is bad. Something I hope improves if there are AI companions in The Last Of Us Part II is the AI's pathing when following the player.

bulger_paul,"I had been interested in checking out this game since it first came out, but I only got my first Playstation ever a few weeks ago, so I had no way to do so until recently, and, well, I'm a little disappointed.,,Don't get me wrong, the things people praise about this game are every bit as good as I'd heard, this game has excellent writing and voice acting, Ellie and Joel's relationship is edifying to watch unfold and to discuss, but there's just something that's ""missing"" in the link between storytelling and gameplay mechanics that's difficult for me to get over.,,When I say there's something ""missing,"" what I mean to say, is there's no connection between storytelling and gameplay at all. This game is like a Skinner box, but with a bunch of extra steps. You go through an area with some very light, often times tedious puzzle solving that usually boils down to ""find the thing and move the thing that lets you jump over the other thing,"" or ""find the thing that lets you open the thing,"" interspersed with a ton of moments comprised of ""kill every dude in the area who isn't you,"" before you're rewarded with another cutscene, and I can't count how many times I found myself disappointed the minute a cutscene ended and the gameplay began, because it meant another solid 30-60 minutes of trudging through not particularly great gameplay to get rewarded with another cutscene.,,That brings me to my second major issue with this game: the gameplay, on its own, really just isn't that good. As I mentioned earlier, it is almost entirely broken up into two kinds of sequences, 1) wandering around a small area to find the thing that let's you get past the obstacle, or 2) killing every dude on the map who isn't you, and that's it. It's interspersed with some exciting moments, like a moment where you're trying to push start a truck while finding off clickers, or a moment where you're defending Ellie from Clickers while she tries to free you from a trap that has you suspended upside-down, but these moments are few and far between gameplay that is, overall, bog standard, and does absolutely nothing to enhance the narrative through its mechanics, you simply just do a few objectives using mechanics that have little to with the narrative, so you can be rewarded with some new cutscenes, and that's about it. And all of that doesn't even get into the dozens of odd moments where the gameplay and story are completely at odds with each other in quite baffling ways. For example, there's a scene where a dude is on top of you trying to drown you, and then Ellie shoots him to save you, then later in the game, there's a moment where Joel is rationalizing her action to save you, telling her not to worry about the fact that she just killed a man, since it was either ""him or me [Joel],"" but it makes absolutely no sense that Joel would need to cauterize that one particular action in that one particular moment, considering the fact that Ellie has already helped you kill well over twenty people in the gameplay, which just reinforces the fact that the gameplay and story departments working on this game had little to no crossover with each other. The narrative tells you one story, about Ellie losing her innocence to a harsh, unforgiving world, but in the gameplay, there's no resistance or struggle or pushback at all to Joel killing scores and scores of nameless, faceless, storyless dudes all for the sake of advancing to the next cutscene.,,All and all, The Last of Us is a real shame, because the acting and writing are truly very good, but the narrative just gets put on hold during gameplay sequences that have barely have anything to do with the narrative, and do nothing at all to enhance the narrative, and I find it disappointing that what has been almost universally lauded as one of the greatest video games ever made has a story that does nothing to take advantage of the fact that it is an interactive medium and capable of telling you a story through mechanical interactions.,,I'm not going to call this game ""overrated"" because I do truly understand why this game emotionally resonated with so many people, but I'm still disappointed all the same and I really wish I had loved this game more than I did.",normal,ps4,2019-06-21,English,0,0,6,train

coorhys,"In short, an absolute masterpiece.  The universal acclaim heaped upon this game is certainly justified, as the game that defined the PS3 at the end of it's lifecycle is almost certainly going to go down as one of the greatest games on the PS4 also.,,The story is superb, with some of my favourite characters in all of gaming.  Naughty Dog is in a class of their own when it comes to crafting a narrative over the length of an entire campaign, even surpassing the mighty Rockstar.  This story can take you through touching moments, harrowing and terrifying moments, along with some instances of humour to provide some levity; and the fact that you are gripped from start to finish really speaks volumes to the level of storytelling on display here.  You will love these characters and be fully invested in their struggles and goals.,,The graphics were excellent even on PS3, however the visuals have been given the next-gen treatment here to fully realise what I'm sure was the original vision all along.  The fact that these visuals still hold up to the best the PS4 can offer show how masterful Naughty Dog are.,,Gameplay-wise, everything is smooth and deliberate, with a real weight and grounding in realism, which stops the dreaded floaty feel some games can suffer from, which for me really pulls you out of the experience, and ruined games such as The Witcher 3, for example.  Combat is heavy and hard hitting, very in tone with the dark, gritty world The Last of Us is built around.,,This is my absolute favourite game of all time, and I cannot in any way recommend it enough.  If you haven't played it yet, do it now.  Especially at the price you can find it for now.  Simply put, if you are even remotely interested in gaming, this is THE game to experience the absolute best this medium has to offer.

AsaZimbabwe,"Good looking game with a fairly intimate, character driven story set in a redundant post-apocalypse that gets off to an interesting start.,,The gameplay becomes repetitive fast, and ranges from boring to tedious; ultimately boiling down to extreme resource management, guess-work, and stealth, with occasional quicktime events and cut-scenes.,,Although it gives the appearance of a realistic open environment, it is actually extremely linear. You are almost always forced through strict, unintuitive corridors with only one way to progress.,,There are dozens of obvious openings, walk-arounds, things to climb, and paths in the environment that should be easy to traverse, which are blocked by invisible walls.,,The girl can't swim, so go get the inevitable wooden plank hidden around the corner and bring it back for her to cross. Ad nauseam.,,The AI is completely ridiculous and often immersion-breaking. The two generic enemy types --humans and clickers-- both just walk aimlessly around the environment in patterns akin to the 8-bit era, apparently doing nothing at all in totally random locations -- that happen to perfectly block your only path.,,What is intended to build tension ends up feeling forced and frustrating.,,What little action there is is hampered by archaic mechanics, and brazenly unimaginative enemy difficulty scaling. For example, if the same enemy you've encountered dozens of times suddenly happens to be wearing a generic construction hardhat, they will take two or three extra shots, no matter where you hit them. Even if you clearly shoot them in the face. There is no acknowledgement of accuracy, each enemy is just one giant hit-box, so there is essentially no point in aiming, very unsatisfying.,,The gameplay is so stale that comparisons to The Walking Dead tv show are inescapable and likely to leave players wondering why they're even bothering with the under-utilized Dual Shock controller instead of just watching another so-so zombie tale.,,For a AAA title, it is easy to appreciate some of the risks this game takes, focusing on character arcs, mood, storytelling, and an attempted sense of immersion in a bleak, realistic world; unfortunately it is hard to ignore the weak gameplay which undermines its loftier intentions.,,The Last of Us actually makes much more sense in its TellTale Games spinoff interactive comic format. On the PS4, remastered, it is barely a step above interactive movie, and not significantly improved from its original PS3 release.,,Not bad, but not much fun to play.

Alsethe2nd,"I never experienced the original The Last Of Us and couldn't resist buying it after all the praise it got from family, friends and online, It was definitely worth it. The Last Of Us has one of the most gripping narratives in any game I have ever played accompanied by its tight and quick gameplay and simplistic yet genius musical score all bundled up with the remastered graphics, which at times surprised me with the beauty at which a game released in 2014 could produce.,,The story can be summed up as, the main characters Joel and Ellie are sent out into a post pandemic world outside the safer quarantine zone (that's the best I can do without spoilers), the story has you falling in love with the characters and wishing to see there story through to the end. The whole thing is an emotional roller coaster that you don't want to get off of.,,Adding on, the gameplay makes you feel like a survivor (especially on higher difficulties), fighting humans for resources and just to live, avoiding zombies if at all possible, the HUD is all tightly connected and accessible making combat and crafting smooth and although the game is catered towards a stealth approach it is not very necessary if playing on difficulties lower than Survivor, which by the time you are playing on these difficulties you will already have been use to the mechanics of it anyway. Moreover, humanities desperate situation is again emphasised by its brilliant artistic design, which in the dark the cities evoke fear in the player and the need to survive, so much so that for the beginning of the game I found myself scared of dying, and at day the cities are beautiful almost showing some hope for humanity yet to be claimed.,,One of my favourite parts of the game is its amazing sound track, the music whilst simplistic sets all the necessary tones for each scene only adding to what is already amazing and not taking anything away. If you have somehow not played this game and found my review I urge you to play it (especially if you like story driven games) it feels you with so much emotion and fear and is an experience you really should not miss out on.

Очень классно проработаны мельчайшие детали. Например гуляя по брошенным домам, можно найти очень много пасхалок да и вообще, просто веришь, что раньше здесь жили люди. Куча различнх постеров в комнатах, игрушки и т.д. Очень атмосферно. Так же очень нравится геймплей. Каждый противник по-настоящему опасен, а припасов немного, поэтому часто приходится проходить по стелсу, а он здесь очень хорошо проработан. Получается так, что ты чувствуешь главного героя, боишься, а не заметят ли тебя? Ну и напоследок конечно же саундтрек. Он настолько атмосферный, простой, но при этом гениальный.

The game design is really similar to the Uncharted series (both games are made by Naughty Dog). There are a lot of checkpoints, so you don't have to start a level all over again.

La obra de Naughty Dog centrada en el apocalipsis zombie es una cruda muestra de cómo avanzaría la sociedad si se diera este tipo de pandemia. Así, con la creación de Joel y Ellie, la compañía estadounidense nos ofrece dos de los mejores personajes de la historia de los videojuegos, una pareja desigual que compenetra de manera perfecta.

Cloud302,"I've been a gamer for over two decades now (ever since the original Nintendo), and I can firmly and confidently say that this is THE best game I've ever played.,,This game without a doubt deserves 5/5. I feel that anyone that gives it less didn't get what it was trying to do. This isn't a standard video game. It's primary purpose is to tell you a story. An interactive story, where you actually feel like you're there with the characters, experiencing everything with them as they experience it. It's something books and movies can't quite pull off, and is video game specific. Even among games, it's extremely rare that a truly successful and well-done interactive narrative can be pulled off so successfully. Everything really matters.,,The only downside I can think of is that there is a ton of swearing, and a pretty decent amount of violence, so this game isn't for the little ones below 10 years. Also, the AI does odd stuff occasionally. But virtually everything else is virtually flawless, breath-taking, heart-breaking, and intense. The writing, art & environments, acting, and music are all above top-notch. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, whether it be due to wondering what's lurking around the corner, or to hear what interesting tid-bit your in-game companions will say next.,,I suppose, in the end, the reason why I love it so is simply because it explores the range and depth of human emotion.,,This game is for anyone and everyone that appreciates a good story. If you've ever enjoyed a fictional book, movie, or video game, in your entire life, you owe yourself this experience. Do what you have to do, to become the last of us. You won't regret it.,,P.S. You should really read the very short prequel comics first (before playing the game), written by the head writer of the game. They're official storyline, and really do add a lot of little neat things and details to the game that you wouldn't appreciate or would miss otherwise.",normal,ps4,2019-02-27,English,0,0,10,train

This is so much better than a zombie game.

How Joel and Ellie eventually bond are are near inseparable i loved, the Combat is pretty decent, i did enjoy upgrading my equipment weapons ect saving parts for that next upgrade which would really help further into the game. The voice acting is amazing, the graphics are beautiful and the Difficulty hard+ is a good challenge, multiple attempts on Hard in many tense moments where had, always a fan of those ""collectibles"" scattered around the game which made me always double check my surroundings for those hidden items. Many tears where shed during the playing of this Game many times over, I initially was very excited on the announcement of Part 2 but the more we have been shown and told I am slightly uncertain and somewhat scared of the franchise, especially my strong belief they have killed Joel off screen an insult to how vital and important Joel is to the story and how Ellie and Joel are two pieces that fit. lets hope I am wrong and part 2 is amazing",normal,ps4,2019-02-17,English,0,0,9,train
Polygoncrafter,"The Last Of Us...A game that I liked the first time I played and finished it. The second time though, I realized that this is a game you spend 80% - 90% of your time crouching and sneaking that it becomes a chore and becomes boring. No replay value. The game is heavily stealth based which is not bad, but this game's stealth mechanics is a poor one. Maybe if they have included setting up traps and commanding your ai partner in the gameplay, it would have been more fun and engaging. Just because the story is dark and it's an emotional game, doesn't mean the gameplay shouldn't be. I think the only reason why a lot of people like this, me included is because of the voice acting and how real the characters are. But as a game, it doesn't offer much in the gameplay department. I would still recommend this game nonetheless as it's a great experience the first time but loses it magic if you replay it.",normal,ps4,2019-02-14,English,3,2,5,train

Coop123,"The Last of Us Remastered may be one of the greatest games ever made. This was my first time experiencing the game having never played the original version. The only major differences in the remaster is an increase in frames and improved graphics. Even though the game is well over four years old, graphically it stands strong and is able to compete with the newest releases. The face animation is perfect and the environments and little details are amazing. The game also has a great sound direction that should not be over looked. Disturbing noises from the infected, the voice acting, and the phenomenal soundtrack add so much immersion and beauty to the game. The story is simple and definitely a concept you have seen before but this game shows you its all about execution. The way the world has changed and how they respond to something like a zombie invasion feels real and it really portrays how human beings behave and is a great study on human nature. The characters feel so honestly written and every moment and character introduced has a significant role to play making the story absolute perfection and a great step for narratives in video games. The story is sad and depressing and there are few true and happy moments in this game, but when there are it feels really unique. The biggest plus is the way you find yourself attached to the characters and how they grow and develop but another thing Naughty Dog did not fail at was the game-play. The game focuses on third person cover based shooting and stealth. The game gives you the option on how you can approach the enemies, and many different tools as well. Shooting and stealth feel really good but scavenging for items and choosing what to craft at what moment feels personalized and adds a lot of depth and fits the survival narrative. Switching between infected and the human enemies is a great design choice and fighting them is always nerve racking thanks to the way the communicate with one another or the disgusting sounds they make. The game is near perfection and the only complaint i have is the over reliance of moving crates and ladders. There are only a few nitpicks but overall the last of us is a truly special experience and is a must have for everyone.",normal,ps4,2019-01-16,English,0,0,10,train

Gamesearcher1,"I had extremely high expectations for this game, more than many other critically-acclaimed games. But this game did something completely different. It massively surpassed them. The story revolves around Joel and Ellie, two extremely contrasting individuals on a life-altering quest. And their tale is certainly not a happy one. Along the way, you meet unforgettable characters, and witness some unforgettable moments. Combat is up first, and this was one of the aspects that nagged me before playing the game. But Naughty Dog did this really well. In every combat scenario, you can either do some cover shooting, or sneak past the enemies. There is a multitude of weapons to do this with, which are all found at a relatively good pace. But sneaking is by far the best option. Not only just food, drink, shelter and joy are in low quality here. Ammo is hard to come by, compared to other games, so Joel's motto of 'make them count' is absolutely true. You can interact with items around the world, and they will make your life easier. Bottles and bricks highlight the biggest flaw in the game, though. The AI. The AI is more broken than the world where the game is set. It is absolutely horrendous sometimes, and does take away from the realism, especially when people turn away from you, the person who they're meant to kill, to focus on a bottle. The zombie variants are small, but each one is extremely different, and are tackled very differently. Listen Mode is a handy tool available in the lower difficulties, that, for the lack of a better term, lets you see what you hear, and is useful whenever you find yourself in the same room as a couple infected, and need a plan. It also helps that the game also looks quite stellar, and the use of lighting is extremely notable. The game uses music rarely, and only for key moments. While I like the music, and it fits the game perfectly, there is a sheer lack of tracks. It just sounds like one track is used, although with its pace slowed or sped-up. I won't state anything about the story, because its something best experienced by the game itself, but the confusion, sorrow and shock displayed by the first chapter keeps rolling till the last.

The story, characters, gameplay, presentation, atmosphere, music, soundtrack, pacing are all top-notch!  TLOU has been one of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life. I was 16 years old at the time of release (June 2013 on PS3) and I've never played a videogame before that is so riveting, emotional moving and so relatable in many ways. The journey of Joel and Ellie is brutal, violent, hopeless and yet so beautiful. The love between these two characters and the relationship that is developing throughout the game is the centerpiece of the experience. You can easily put yourself in Ellie and Joel's shoes, because every action they make is understandable and relatable. I can't wait to play the continuation of Ellie and Joel's journey!!

The characters here are written so well and made so honest and sincere. I do not want to describe much of the character growth to avoid spoilers, but i must say this game will make you forget everything and you will feel like Joel and Ellie are actual human beings. The plot behind the game is a basic standard zombie story but done in a unique way. The way you see how humans behave in this game after the apocalypse says a lot about human behavior and what people are really like. The original soundtrack is beautiful and gives you chills every-time you hear it. The game play is perfect as well mixing Shooting, crafting, and a lot of patience and thinking. The enemy encounters are switched up with humans and clickers and runners and perhaps the clickers. The game is intense and nerve racking and will frustrate you and actually make you fearful.

I'd get more out of this if I watched a well scripted condensed edited lets play on the Internet for sure.,,Full of scripted cheating BS that forces you into stupid insane avoidable situations. Oh and the combat is so unrefined to the point of jank. What is with the slow cumbersome wobbly aim of a geriatric in a care home. So like have the developers really ever picked up a bow/pistol/rifle and shot one ffs?

If you still haven't played this game, do that.,,I'm not going to write usual information such as the history of the game, genre and so on. I'm going to describe emotions which the game can share with you. Because this game, first of all, is about emotions. Then it is about shooting, zombies, post-apocalypse.,,You won't be the main decision maker or a  central person. Accept this idea and relax. You are a spectator. Of course, you will shoot, hide, craft, upgrade skills, fear and do one hundred typical adventure actions. But the core of the game-play is to watch how relations between Joel and Elie change and grow. And it is amazing. I think the developers specially made a choice for Elie's age as 13 years old. They have crossed out all potential questions about sexuality between heroes. It helps leave only a human layer without gender problems. A risky tactic in the 21 century with sexual pop culture.,,So, you will be an invisible part of the crew consisting of old cynical Joel and young cheeky Elie at the end of the times. And keep in mind, that zombies are a simple environment. The developers can change them to werewolves, vampires, aliens... It is not important, because all the stories in our lives are always about people. And you will understand that the most dangerous monster in a man. He is unpredictable, he kills for fun, he is smart and always lies.,,Anyway, I can promise, you are going to believe in Joel and Elie. They will take a place in your memories as real people. And you will love them.,,The general questions which the authors took as background for the game are who we are. What does make us humane? Does mankind have a chance for something bigger than we have now?,,PS. Most of the reviews of the game skip describing the soundtrack of the game. Author of it is Gustavo Santaolalla and he conveyed a strong and deep feeling of the world from Last of Us.",normal,ps4,2018-10-09,English,0,0,10,train
brainstormer,"The Last of Us is a great survival horror game that succeeds on providing a compelling story and an intense gameplay. It oozes with atmosphere and style, and it is truly one of the best games games for PS4. But, that being said, it does have some flaws, and those flaws mainly being the mediocre AI and the occasional breakage of immersion. These flaws are by no means game-breaking, however they do affect the overall experience in a minor but noticeable way.,The gameplay is intense and appropriate for its overall theme, however it does get a bit tedious at times, especially the ""platforming"" segments sometimes being slow. The action can get really intense and these segments do require strategic planning. Whether you want to play stealthy or guns blazing, that's your choice, however, since this is a survival game, there will be a shortage of ammo and resources so you better choose carefully your style of playing and balancing these ways of playing is essential, especially on high difficulties. The shooting feels heavy and impactful, just like it should since this game strives for realism more than not, and while it doesn't totally succeed at that, it still does a fine job at delivering an intense experience.  The melee combat also feels punchy and it is brutal. The crafting system is nice, adding to the survival aspect of the game. Searching for materials increases the importance of exploration, which is key for crafting and for gathering materials to upgrade certain elements of your gear. There are two main types of enemies: human enemies and infected enemies. Both types can offer intense challenges. And there are different kinds of infected enemies and human enemies, all of them being well designed, So the gameplay is appropriate to the game's gritty and dark theme by being intense and brutal, thus adding to the immersion, But what diminishes the immersion is the occasional non-sense whenever your friendly AI goes face to face with the enemy, and the enemy doesn't detect your companion. While it does somehow make sense that this is the case and I do understand that it is hard to program an AI in a way for it to always act perfectly, it just is a bit ridiculous sometimes.,The story has some very compelling characters and the dialogue, the voice acting... they are top-notch. Its writing seriously rivals those of Hollywood movies. It is cinematic, emotional and intense. I know, I've used the word ""intense"" many times by now, but that's the perfect description for this game. It is its main essence. And, while these stories have been done before, it's still done here with expertise and with care. Many people say that this game could've easily been made as a movie, and that is true. But the game itself doesn't want to be a movie, since the gameplay is still very substantial and enjoyable. This is easily the best cinematic game that I've ever played.",normal,ps4,2018-10-06,English,0,0,9,train

tomvs123,"As a zombie fan and amazing story lover, I was looking forward to playing this one. But, I was disappointed.,,To put it simply: This is a great game for the average gamer who has never experienced a good story, and who doesn't mind plot holes. But for the story lovers and those of us who are looking for new experiences in video games, you might be disappointed.,,The gameplay is really what this game is all about. Gameplay comes first and the story was built around it. And it's just a run-of-the-mill 3rd person action/stealth game, much like the Uncharted games, though there's more emphasis on inventory management and stealth in this game.,,During gameplay, you'll be going to a new area, killing everything that moves, and then going to the next area. Repeat that about 100 times to beat the game.,,What's worst about most of the gameplay is that it makes no sense story-wise. Why is it necessary to kill all other people I meet? Why do people instantly want to kill me on sight? Why do random people suddenly show up at my location at the exact same time I show up (and attempt to murder me)? It's not explained. It's just how the game works. The only time where you get to talk to other humans, rather than killing them is in cut scenes. It makes the story feel quite forced and disconnected from the gameplay.,,For the various story scenarios, basically take every zombie tv show and movie made before this game, nab all of the best scenes, and then put them into this game. I really felt like I was watching a rerun. This isn't necessarily bad, but again, I'm looking for a new experience and not the same-old zombie stuff.,,As for the main plot, it's quite weak and full of plot holes. Without spoiling anything, the main character (that you play primarily) is just a selfish/greedy old man that the game tries to portray as being heroic and just. His actions don't make sense, unless you accept that he's just stupid. He just ""believes"" things are right and does them, despite the evidence in front of him. And you don't get to go on a journey to find more evidence or to learn more about the world: instead your journey is full of murdering everyone that disagrees with you.,,The story just doesn't hold up to scrutiny and is actually quite bad when completely dissected. Though I must say that the little girl sections of it weren't that bad because she actually acts believably given her circumstances.,,So, the game isn't really for me, though I prefer stories with minimal plot holes, reasonable character actions, and gameplay that doesn't directly conflict with the story. Though for those who love Uncharted, this might be right up your alley.",normal,ps4,2018-10-03,English,9,3,3,train

The performances are still amazing. The visuals are still stunning.

The issues the characters face are really quite small in the grand view of things. Terrible, yes. But small. But that’s what makes it so hard and sad and uncomfortable. We can become detached about bad things when we don’t experience them personally. But these characters are so real and we grow so attached to them that we do experience the tragedies personally, in a way.,,And in order to do that the story HAS to be small and only focus on a few people.,,Only a consistently solid company like Naughty Dog could craft such a singularly perfect experience.

TatsMcGee,"This is a game that I have been wanting to play for awhile, I bought it a few months back and then it was just sitting and collecting dust. I finally decided that I would give it a shot. The Uncharted franchise is one of my favorite franchises and I felt some internal pressure to play this game as well.,,I’m really over the whole Zombie craze and knowing the game is essentially about Zombies, I knew I would have to be in the mood to play a game like this. I am very glad that I did finally sit down and play through the game.,,The story is pretty good or at least in opinion as good as it can be when a story is written about a Zombie apocalypse. The driving force of this game are the two main characters and most importantly the development of these two characters. You have an older gentleman named Joel who goes through a traumatic event right at the start of the game and Ellie who is a young girl. She is 14 years old and has gone through her own struggles. The two start out as Strangers but as the game moves forward, the two start to develop a bond.,,I enjoyed the gameplay to an extent. The shooting is just like Uncharted, there is a lot less traversing landscapes and buildings and a lot more stealth. As I’m sure you’re aware, I’m not crazy about Stealth but this games stealth isn’t the worst thing. As long as you’re quiet you can move along and not have to worry about it too much.,,My biggest gripe about the game is, it can start to feel repetitive towards the end. There is one particular “puzzle” where you need to escort Ellie across a body of water. She is unable to swim so you need to find a wooden pallet to escort her over the water. After about the first couple times doing that, I was kind of sick of doing it. It doesn’t happen too often but maybe 3-5 times in a single playthrough.,,This is a very well made game but I do like the Uncharted series more. It comes down to personal preference but this is a darker game, it takes itself very seriously. It’s not a case where it takes itself so seriously that it has a stick up its ass but its a much more serious tone.,,It is also important to note that I played this game on easy, I don’t play linear action-adventures for a challenging experience.

jrdnnn,"Finally playing this game after 5 years and it's worth the wait. Last of Us Remastered is a quintessential PS4 game and one of the most emotional storylines I've witnessed across all media. The quest of Joel and Ellie is touching, tense, brutal and shocking, and they are two of the strongest videogame characters of the decade. I absolutely loved every aspect of the story and can't fault it - this game takes the rough idea behind The Walking Dead and truly does justice to the human vs. human in an apocalyptic society trope, unlike the aforementioned TV show.,,Gameplay-wise, I enjoyed most of it. The controls are tight, combat (especially gunplay) is solid, the on-the-fly crafting mechanics were great and the exploration was pretty good. The upgrade trees for weapons and skills felt a little insignificant in the long-run and prevented true enhancements. The absence of incentives for exploring off the beaten path however were poor compared to the Uncharted series and was a disappointment to me. The world is gorgeous and interesting, yet basically boiled down to a corridor-type approach with occasional locked doors to explore. Considering the setting and style of game, this is a major flaw in my opinion. This said, I was never bored, loved the environments and the graphics are fantastic, I just wanted more variety in game progression akin to all the optional caves and treasures of, say, Tomb Raider or Uncharted 4.,,The production values of the game are incredible. Light effects, the score, the environments, the small touches to abandoned houses, the facial animations - amazing. This game is a true experience to play through, both visually and emotionally, and is without a doubt deserving of the praise it gets in these respects. The DLC was really nice for a bit of background to Ellie and only helped me love her more. Despite some gameplay issues for me, Last of Us joins Bloodborne, Uncharted 4, Nier: Automata and Horizon : Zero Dawn in the ranks of games you simply must play if you own a PS4, but for reasons different to the other four. This is the most engaging and personal story I think I've came across in gaming since some of the PSOne Final Fantasies or Metal Gear Solid 3, and what it lacks in gameplay/exploration depth, it makes up for in spades with the raw emotion and intricacy of its heartbreaking narrative.",normal,ps4,2018-07-31,English,0,0,8,test

FreedomFighters,"I guess it's worth addressing the elephant in the room for a second: ""The Last of Us"" is the first post-""Crash Bandicoot"" Naughty Dog game that I've played, and given that I played and beat the original ""Crash Bandicoot"" trilogy only as part of the Vicarious Visions ""N-Sane Trilogy"" remakes (instead of their original versions), this is essentially the first game fully developed by Naughty Dog that I have played and beaten. And admittedly, I approached this one with some very real caution: yes, the game received glowing reviews and many Game of the Year awards back in 2013, but so too did ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" a game I somewhat notoriously (or maybe I just think that) rated a 7 out of 10 in my review, contrary to the 9 and 10 scores that everyone was handing out to it left and right. Even if ""The Last of Us"" was a completely different game, it became clear as soon as I handed that score to ""Grand Theft Auto V"" that even one of the most beloved and popular games of all-time didn't do it for me, so I actually worried that ""The Last of Us"" would suffer the same fate. Fortunately, dear readers, it didn't. In fact, it ended up becoming one of my personal favorite games.,""The Last of Us"" is a wonder to behold in basically every facet: the story is moving and emotional, is excellent in its handling of themes like survival, family, togetherness, and even subtle themes of gender roles and sexuality. Furthermore, considering that I'm not very good at crying, the fact that this game got me pretty damn close to crying at several points is really something. The characters are also impeccably written (specifically Ellie, who is the true highlight of the game), and the relationship between Joel and Ellie is fantastic, as it's the perfect example of true, genuine, legitimately character growth in a story. Each character, even down to the secondary ones, are also further brought to life by an array of excellent performances from its very talented cast, and I find the moral ambiguity and flawed nature of the characters to be extremely fascinating, as it brings an air of realness to them. The game's post-apocalyptic world is brilliantly designed and believably lonely, able to mask the fact that it is so linear by still giving you plenty of areas to explore, and the graphics are absolutely breathtaking (the added PS4 facelift only helps to bring them out further). I also love the game's use of music and sound, and I find that the often lighter, more haunting nature of the sound design only helps add to the loneliness that the world tries to create. Also, while I initially worried going into the game that the gameplay would suffer as a result of the emphasis on story, I'm happy to report that I was very wrong: the gameplay is fantastic. The game's crafting system adds an interesting air of strategy to the game and keeps you on your toes, the combat is engrossing and exciting, and the stealth sections are also extremely satisfying. Oh, and getting to play the game at 60 frames per second thanks to this remaster only helps make for a more smooth gameplay experience.,If there is one EXTREMELY minor flaw I can mention about the game, it's that the enemy AI can be just a tad bit wonky during stealth sections, but said sections are so tensing and edge-of-your-seat thrilling that it's honestly easy to look past.,This is it: this really is one of the finest video games ever made. I was skeptical at first, but ""The Last of Us"" hooked me in right from the jump and never let me go. If you haven't gotten a chance to play this masterpiece yet...stop whatever you're doing and fix that!,Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic""",normal,ps4,2018-07-23,English,1,1,10,test

Dr_Paganini,"What can I say about ""The Last of Us"" that hasn't been said already. Well It'd have to be MY personal experience with it. It took me 4 years to buy this game. Mainly due to my concern being that it was ""Uncharted"" with a zombie twist. Plain and simple I was dead wrong. This is what games should aspire to be. This is the only game that I've ever cried in. Not because I was sad or frustrated but because it was more beautiful than i expected. The story alone should be enough to buy it. It was able to emotionally grip me and have me so invested that I couldn't put down my controller because i felt i needed to go on. The game play is pretty basic but it does it so well that it isn't a bad thing. Much like how ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" takes the best elements of Open-World games and makes them better, ""The Last of US"" does the same thing by taking the cover-shooter elements from ""Uncharted"" but makes it WAY more brutal and raw that you feel the impact of your bullets and punches. Unlike most zombie games I've played, the infected actually pose a much more real threat than humans do. Most might see this as a bad thing but personally i don't. What makes the infected encounters so intense is that you have VERY limited ammo. So you have to play smart by crafting shivs and manipulating the AI by throwing bricks/bottles in the opposite direction.The same can be said about the humans but unlike the infected you don't feel as scared because they're just like you and that means you don't feel as obligated to play smart which gives you the ability to go ham with your shotgun. If by now you aren't convinced to buy this game, then i don't know what will. This is what a masterpiece looks like and most games wish they could achieve this level of greatness.",normal,ps4,2018-06-18,English,0,0,10,test

Nate3nate,"TLOU is the most overrated game in gaming history, nothing about it is above a 5.  The ambiance is generic Half-Life 2 meets Zombies (go play HL2 and tell me the whole camp/atmosphere doesn't feel like a complete rip), the store is generic zombie virus outbreak with nothing new, the characters are bland, the game play is boring, and the puzzles can be solved by my dog (my literal dog who has paws which you would think would make the puzzles challenging but nah).,,I could go on and break down every part of this travesty of a game, but I'll ask 1 simple question which I know none of the people that loved this game asked.,,Why did the soldier shoot your daughter?,,There is no reason that at the beginning of the outbreak, when no one could possibly know what is going on, the soldier would have fired upon you or that the soldier's commander would have ordered it.  Remember this outbreak wasn't something that had been ongoing for a long time, this just happened straight up in the night, and because of it the military was mobilized.  Hell even if they knew something crazy was going on the military doesn't just shoot civilians, especially considering that soldier was as green as they come (probably national guard).  That whole dramatic scene makes no sense once you think about it and the same can be said for pretty much everything else after that.,,Run down guy who double crossed you and viciously beat/murder him, but rebel lady threatens you and suddenly you're all soft now?  Yeah that's not how real life works.,,Random girl holds the key to ending the outbreak but suddenly your character decides she's more important to him personally so they run off?  F humanity right?  So all the daughters in the world will suffer and die but generic male character number 1 doesn't care cause he's got one of his own right here.  (That's super creepy btw),,The story is completely full of logical fallacies that the ""10ers"" clearly did not stop to actually think about.  But fine, I expect that from most people, so hows the game play?,,Well do you like stealth games that do the stealth well, say Splinter Cell?,,Yeah well the stealth in this game is garbage.,,Do you like games that have interesting level design and allow you to chose your timing vs enemies when using stealth?,,Too bad, you're always a ledge drop away from not being able to back track and thus being stuck in a room with ZOMBIES THAT CANNOT CLIMB SO IF YOUR CHARACTER GOT HIS HEAD OUT OF HIS ASS HE WOULD JUST ALERT THE ZOMBIES FROM UP HIGH AND KILL THEM ALL WITHOUT ISSUE BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO your character is too damn stupid to actually develop a strategy vs zombies that makes any sense.,,Do you like weapons?,,Ha!  No weapons for you!  You get shivs, really poorly crafted shivs and if you don't have those you're pretty much f'ed because lord knows in a post apocalyptic wasteland there's never any knives to be had.  God forbid your character ever gets an actual melee weapon.,,Hey remember those spore puffs that can infect people?  Yeah they only do that when the plot needs them too, otherwise your character pretty much just ignores them after the first scene with them.,,Look...,,You want a game with great story?,Go play Knights of the Old Republic,,You want a game with great stealth?,Go play Splinter Cell Conviction,,You want a game with great combat?,Go play Battlefield 3,,You want a game with great crafting?,Go play Space Engineers,,You want a game with great tactics/strategy?,Go play Xcom/Xcom 2,,You want a game with great level design?,Go play Deus Ex Human Revolution,,You want a great zombie game?,Go play Dying Light,Why yes I do play a wide verity of games and have been playing games for a good chunk of time now.  Regardless, my point is that TLOU does nothing better than anyone else or even close and if you think it does, go play these other games and see what actual great games are.    TL:DR - Go play something else, this game isn't worth your time and if this is the first game you've ever played please play something on my list before you rate this game and see for yourself how absolutely mediocre TLOU is.",normal,ps4,2018-06-12,English,3,0,5,train

These are my thoughts:,,- The game, despite the remastering, still feels a little dated.,- The game reminded me very much of Uncharted series. The same studio and naturally same feel to it. The only difference is the setting. This is Walking Dead compared to Indiana Jones. For me, Indiana always triumphs over Walking Dead (the actual series is very underwhelming 7/10 for me). For this reason, I am giving this game a solid 7/10. I have marked Uncharted as 8/10.,- Interesting and well thought out characters.,- Good level design but somewhat linear which is expected.,,All in all, I can see why it is regarded as a classic and I  did enjoy it but not as much as I expected. I had a repelling feeling about it as I bought the game and only played for the first time many months later. Each time I played it, I did so to just finish it and tick the box, but while at it I did enjoy it.,- The game was consistent and had quite a few tense and exciting moments.,,Am I looking forward to the second instalment?

kiank,"The Last of Us: Remastered is an amazing game with one of the best stories in all of gaming.  Joel, Ellie, and Marline are all such strong and amazing characters.  The games opening scene almost had me in tears as Sarah's death was so emotional.  Tess was a great compliment to Joel and she matched him in ruggedness.  Bill is a funny character and another great LGBT representation.  Ellie is such a badass and she is such a strong figure, not only as a female character but also as a LGBT character.  Having cannibals, hunters, and infected creates such an amazing dynamic and I think they have an accurate description of what would happen if this infection occurred.  I think it's similar to The Road.  The scene with Henry and Sam is the most emotional scene in video game history.  Joel's brother shows the very hopeful side of the Last of Us and how civilization and love can persist.  And when Ellie is alone in the winter, her character gets really developed and the whole face off with David is incredible and emotional.

But I can't remember another game that got me so hooked as this one here. The story is so compelling, I found myself wanting to put down the controller to get some sleep only to notice the sun rising through the window, like when I was a child and I was fighting the hordes of undead in Diablo. You just can't let go. And while the graphics aren't top notch, they are as perfect as they need to be. The faces are exceptionally expressive, there's body language, there are even muscle movements almost imperceptible if you're not looking for them, but so important in the big picture. The voice over of the characters take you inside the game and you can't help but fall in love with Joel and Ellie. This is truly a masterpiece of video games.

Aginagala,"The last of us will always be one of my favorite games of all time. Having it remastered brought back all the old nostalgic feelings of when I first played the game. I fell in love with Joel and Ellie and was one of the few games when as I was coming to the last bit of it... I genuinely did not want it to finish.,,The gameplay mechanics are a little bit strange to control at times as Joel wouldn't follow what I was telling him to do, and Ellie running out in front of a bunch of guys or clickers... slightly ruined the immersion but that being said it did not take away that I loved the game, I loved the characters and everything about the story. A fresh new addition building on the kind of escort time game... however never feeling like that as Ellie is helpful, witty, and you genuinely care about her. Another thing I loved about the game is that I have not felt this scared, intimidated and or tense about the zombies in games in a long long time. I loved the feeling of not wanting to be caught and if I did it was over, making you have to be stealthy rather than other games where you can get away with just running around everything, you have to play the game as it's supposed to be played.,,The RPG aspect of the game was also interesting as resources were very scarce rather than a lot of games having an abundance of them laying everywhere, made for a much more believable experience, especially when playing on the harder grounded mode. Quickly crafting a health kit, or perhaps preparing and monitoring your avaliable resources carefully made you think more about what you were doing and for much more intense action and stealth scenes.,,Moreover the new types of zombie known as clickers and their gameplay aspects being different to that of normal zombies... was fantastically implemented as not only did they relate to the story, but they were also terrifying. Coming back and playing it on the PS4 with fixed mechanics genuinely felt like I was in a movie at times with animation and voice acting by award winning Troy Baker and others, emotional scenes felt genuinely moving. This game was the reason for me buying a PS4 in the first place and it is a definite must play for any types of game lovers, fantastic story, brilliant new ideas and concepts along with engaging gameplay, a masterpiece of game design.",normal,ps4,2017-11-13,English,0,0,9,train

Tito23,"Not only the best remastered game, but one of the best games in history. Naughty Dog doesn't know the meaning of failure. Here is my, try to be short, review on The Last of Us Remastered:,,I have to start with this game's strongest attribute. The story. My god, from the very beginning of putting you in tears to the end....practically hitting you in some more feels.This game rivals any great story of anything. Whether that be a book, movie, another game, whatever. I have never been so attached to two characters like Joel and Ellie. The relationship that starts off as a, ""I don't want anything to do with you"" and perfectly paces it to be like a father daughter relationship. You do not have to have your own kid to understand and see the love between the characters. From the get go, it hits you with something that you have never seen in a film or game. Right off the bat and in ways, even though this is another apocalyptic story, everything feels so new like you never have seen an apocalyptic story before.,,Gameplay. Gameplay is nothing revolutionary, but it most definitely done right and fits perfectly in this game's atmosphere. From the crafting to the scavenging and the ridiculous amounts of bricks and bottles to throw, it all feels right. I never got a thought of, wow.. this is retarded and not needed or even repetitive. The gameplay has the perfect flow, the perfect feel, and just done right in the right situations. I find the most interesting is the Clickers and different forms of the infected. They are not your typical, ""hey I am dead and want to eat you for no reason"" that we see nonstop from other games, movies, and shows alike.. They actually did some research and came up with a unique element that makes this whole end of world concept feel new. An actual disease. It is a fungal disease from ants that make them burst this fungus disease and make them eventually blind as well kills them. They develop a hostile nature and practically attacks everything they hear or feel. So to the storyline of the last of us, the disease grew and mutated and started effecting the human race.,,The cons of this game is that you will have to do something like punch a bear and get your manhood back. Because you will hit feelings you didn't know you had because us men are rock solid. But Naughty Dog brought a rock crusher so just be ready. I have no input on the multiplayer. Never played that part of the game, just the main and the story DLC, which is just as good even though 2 hours long. But hey, it is free so cant complain. But I have heard a lot of positive feedback on the multiplayer even though this is not a multiplayer focused game.,,All I can say is if you have not, buy and play this masterpiece.

Then the gameplay cuts in and it's about helping the AI get to another area of the map. Repositioning ladders, opening doors, etc. That's the exploration aspect, which would have been fine if the gameplay wasn't so stifling. In actuality, it's a boring cover-shooter just like every other cover shooter. Except it's not innovative or unique.

For me and what I look for in video games The Last of Us is as perfect of a game as I could ever hope to find.  You play as Joel.  A middle aged parent living in a quarantine zone in Boston.  I won't give too much away but Joel has a friend named Tess, and both are very good at smuggling.  It becomes quite apparent that what is left of the United States government is corrupt and loves censorship.  Anyway, it is really hard to give you much more than that without spoiling a lot.  It is not an open world game.  Instead it focuses on a more linear approach but at the same time rewards exploring players.  You will need supplies and ammunition both of which are very hard to find so make everything count.  I also suggest playing on hard your first run through.  Normal can be a bit too easy at times.

BlakDak666,"The Last of Us Remastered is a amazing game that displays a stunning visual world and captivating story about internal and external conflicts over survival in a inhospitable world. The performances of Ashley Johnson as Ellie and Troy Baker as Joel is career defining, giving wonderful moments both in physical and emotional moments as one progresses in the game. The combat is fun and a test of skill, luck and stealth that makes engagements dire and FUBAR on harder modes. The strangling of enemies is kind of loud and admittedly the AI is not really that smart on some things, but these are easily glossed over by the power the game has at telling a story and telling it well. Usually perfection is something out of grasp in things (games no different), but the ending is the very rare diamond gaming moment that deserves to be called perfect and nothing less.,,The Remastered edition comes with the Left Behind DLC, which tells a story of Ellie's past mixed with her present day self in a thoughtful and well done way that deserves alot of praise. It also has a commentary that is fascinating to watch and the updated visuals and framerates make the experience of the story truly spectacular. The downside is the multiplayer..sort of. The inclusion of multiplayers in the Uncharted games have always been an issue with me because it was a means to compete with Microsoft's Gears of War  and as a player of both mps, Gears destroys Uncharted's mp. They just don't belong in the game (like they were tacked on) and just a way to get mp hungry players on its game, rather than enjoy its story and just that. The Last of Us has the strongest mp among the Uncharted series and contains its own meta game that is actually quite fun to play. Unfortunately,  the mp has microtransactions (even weapons you can purchase that could be pay-to win) and I cannot let that slide, no matter how good the game is.,,If it ditched it's multiplayer, then the Last of Us would easily be a 10/10 for me without even a moment's thought, but I cannot do it and so a 9/10 will do. This is to say nothing of the game's power and focus of its campaign and it is an absolute must to buy this game if you have not bought it already or just got a PS4.",normal,ps4,2017-03-23,English,0,0,9,train

Realmente las situaciones que se nos presentan se utilizan de manera tan directa y violenta que llegas a sentir que con cada bala quitas una vida, es realmente espectacular el énfasis con el que se trabaja la violencia, independientemente de lo gore que aparente ser,Por esto y por mas es un titulo muy recomendable que te va a transmitir un sentimiento que pocos juegos pueden llegar a hacerlo.",normal,ps4,2017-03-17,Spanish,0,0,10,train

ramsay356,"Summary: One of the only games I consider a 10/10. An absolute masterpiece and best use of a video game to tell a story. A must play for any Naughty Dog fan.,,Full: After thinking long and hard about why this game was so effective and felt like a perfect experience, the answer is simply the word 'real'. The characters, the story, even the way enemies interact are the most realistic I have ever seen in a video game.,The gameplay aspect individually is completely engrossing, you get so caught up in the survival elements that you are compelled to scavenge as much as possible for anything you can craft with or, if you are lucky, a couple bullets. You develop a combination of stealth and shooter elements to handle enemies because its the only way to survive. The game makes you completely feel like you are in the characters shoes. Add in the classic Naughty Dog seamless cutscene integration to keep things fresh and the game flies by while you are glued to this world.,The story and characters are where this game really achieves something special. Escorting Ellie through enemy outposts and infected monsters can be fun, but if you can actually care about her survival the experience is nothing short of captivating. Your eyes open wide every cutscene where she falls down or where you get injured because you genuinely want the best for Joel and Ellie. Its hard to discuss the story much more without spoiling anything, but I doubt I will ever forget it.,In terms of the remaster itself, its hard to imagine it looking or playing any better than it does. Well worth the upgrade to those who owned it on PS3 and will want to play it again and a must buy for anyone yet to play it.,,Rating Justification: I can't fault The Last of Us for anything. It knows what it wants to do and what the experience should feel like and achieves it flawlessly. This is the only 10/10 game I have played in almost a decade.

Hemp316,"Recently I bought A Playstation 4 and always wanted to play this Game since I heard all the hype and high praise of it.To be honest,I bought it new,put it on shelf and did not play it for A whole month.When I did eventually play it I have to say I was not that blown away.The first two or three hours were A bit of A grind and nothing that spectacular-basically just your standard Tutorial sections.,,It wasn't really until mid game where I really started to enjoy myself and I fell in A groove with it's mechanics.Speaking of which,this Game is heavily dependent on items and upgrading those items.This can be A lot of fun and encourages exploration.I was surprised there wasn't A lot of stealth aspects to the Game which is great since all I have ever seen in videos was those sections and often when I played them in the Game itself.,,The graphics are very well done and everything looks as natural and organic than any other Game I have ever seen before and the abandoned feeling rivals that of the Fallout series.The 'monsters' are nicely rendered and are scary and chilling.I think though to myself the scariest parts of this Game are the Human characters since they use strategy and effectively hunt you down as opposed to the Monsters that you can easily trick.,,The characters (without spoiling anything) are dynamic and are well thought out.You can tell A great amount of care and effort was given especially to these two characters as well as secondary characters.The dialogue sounds organic and realistic trying to copy something more closer to real life.At first these characters are people you could care less about.By the end,you are biting your nails with fear over some of the extreme situations you encounter because you care for each one of these characters.They grow through trials of hardship as certain events change their overall dynamic with one another.,,Ultimately,the end really satisfied me and made me become A convert to this series.I understood all the hype and praise and how it was justified.This wasn't A perfect Game though,the swimming was hard especially to dive.I didn't like the cover button as it was clumsy to use and didn't like what button was assigned to.I feel some weapons even when upgraded were virtually useless against Human opponents.The worst is the lack of ammo since as you pass by A lot of Military installations,There should at times should of been A small amount of stockpiles of ammunition.,,Other than these rather ultimately small gripes,this Games does gives you A lot for you money.It is A short Game and most of it is cut scenes,but when you finish all that the Game has to offer you will feel that you have experienced A great Game.If you want to play A well structured,thought out Game with care and balance to it then look no further than to The Last Of Us,You will never regret it.",normal,ps4,2017-03-10,English,1,0,9,test

NateM2021,"“The Last of Us” is a game developed by Naughty Dog Studios and was published by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2013. In this survival horror game, you play as the character named Joel. The plot of the story is how a zombie-like virus had taken over the world and not many  people are alive. The game is in third person, and has multiple features such as a “listening mode”. There is an online multiplayer mode for this game, but for this review I will only cover the story mode.,At the beginning of the virus, Joel and his daughter Sarah are trying to escape, but Sarah is shot and killed from an officer since he thought she was bitten. The game fast forwards years in the future and he goes to this group called the Fireflies and he and his friend Tess need to take a teenager named Ellie to a zone where another group will pick her up. Joel and Tess learn that Ellie had been bitten, but showed no symptoms and supposedly was the “cure” to the infection. The group has to keep moving to other places since things don’t usually work out they way they want to.,The game itself is very story driven, filled with intense cutscenes and heartwarming moments. It does a very excellent job of getting close to the characters, instead of most games where they are just space being taken up. You can during the story have some optional conversations with Ellie that might not impact the story, but can get yourself closer to the character. It breaks my heart whenever I see some close to death moments with the characters because they feel like family almost. The game is an emotional rollercoaster of emotions, going from upset to sad instantly. It was great to watch Joel and Ellie basically become father and daughter.,The gameplay and aesthetics look amazing in this game. There is a complex crafting system where you use materials you find around to make weapons like shivs and other things like health kits and barbed baseball bats. Look wise, just watching a simple cutscene can almost look like real life, and for one of the first few Playstation 4 games, the remaster is brilliant. Everything around you yells lonely apocalypse, but still holds its own beauty. Just looking at rusted cars with flowers and moss around just looks amazing. The different locations you go to all look extremely different, from a sewer to snowy woods. The sound track for me was pretty decent, not the best but still very enjoyable. My only real issue in the game was occasionally Ellie’s AI would make her shoot a gun in stealth.,For people that want to play this game, I would recommend being around 15 and up to play, since there are moments of extreme violence like when you die as Joel sometimes a clicker may rip your neck apart, or ripping your face apart. I would say it’s okay to play if you’re younger as long as you have an adult supervising you. This game sometimes goes extreme with things like burning, destruction of flesh, and even suicide.,Overall, this to me is a near perfect game, since of everything like aesthetics and gameplay, as well as plot development.",normal,ps4,2017-02-13,English,1,0,10,test

TheQuietGamer,"The definitive version of the game, and not just because of it's upgraded graphics. This remastered version also includes extra DLC already on the disc, including the story chapter ""Left Behind."" So if you haven't played the game yet and have a PS4, this is the way to do so. Even if you've already played the game back on the PS3, the extra content and improved visuals are plenty of reasons to consider the upgrade.,,A word of warning though, while generally better looking all around, there are a few areas where the new graphics aren't up to snuff. The character models always look fantastic, but every now and then certain aspects of the environment can look dated. Most of the time though the game looks amazing. There are some really breathtaking moments. It's just that every now and then you'll come across something that makes you think ""Eh, this could look better."" I also encountered a few rare and very minor glitches here and there. Nothing serious though.,,Okay, so now that we've gotten the flaws out of the way (that was literally all of them), we can get into why the game is simply a don't miss experience. Naughty Dog pulled out all of the stops for this one and created one of the most stunning and incredible experiences gaming has to offer. The area where this is most notable is the narrative. Without spoiling too much, The Last of Us tells an emotionally gripping tale set in a fully realized world with some of the best writing and characters I've ever seen in a video game. The brutal, bleak nature of the game is handled marvelously. This is the perfect example of genuinely mature storytelling. The performances that bring these characters to life rival that of the best Hollywood actors. The writing's ability to resonate and effect me is on par with anything I've ever watched in a movie or read in a book. Simply put, the story is phenomenal.,,Given that this is a video game, storytelling alone isn't necessarily enough to give The Last of Us masterpiece status. It also needs to prove itself in the gameplay department. Something the game does strongly. The game does an excellent job of selling the feel of surviving in a world gone to crap. Ammo is scarce, you'll need to scrounge for supplies in order to get by, and crafting your own items is what will often get you by. Combat is savage and can pack quite the challenge. The exciting mix on tense third-person shootouts, brutal melee combat, and edge of your stealth options make it where it's your choice how you survive. Every bullet and item counts, especially on the higher difficulties. Fights require quick and smart thinking, whether you're fighting other well-armed survivors or the speedy infected. In order to fully upgrade Joel's abilities you'll need to playthrough more than once, which makes those new game + options all the more enticing.,,The Last of Us also has an enjoyable multiplayer component, that does a great job of making use of the story mode's mechanics in order to set it apart. You'll scavenge, craft, and use teamwork to win the day. There's also an interesting meta-game that has you winning supplies for the faction you pick. The better you perform and the more your camp will grow. As it does you'll be required to bring in more from your watches. It's an interesting loop that backs up the already strong core gameplay to keep you coming back.,,This game is nothing less than a masterpiece. One that's made even better on PS4 thanks to the included DLC and (mostly) improved visuals. It story stands as among the best gaming has to offer. The gameplay experience is so refined and fun that there's really no reason why anyone should pass this up. This is one of those rare, must-play games that only come around every once in a while and need to played when they do.

HashZ21,"My first experience with this game was the remastered edition on the PS4 and for quite some time it was the most visually stunning game on the console. This game does so many things right that I feel that some of it's faults are easily overlooked. The Game play itself is tense and tight. Every bullet counts, each shiv is important and medication is scare even on the normal difficulty. The horror of this game is based in the horror of man and the suspense of wading through a clicker filled room not knowing if you'll make it through alive. But by far the most important thing in this game is the story. Now I have to admit the story isn't original, but it is well told. The characters are real and the dialogue believable. The lack of clear villains means each side is seen as human as people trying to make the best of a bad situation, but the game doesn't forget to have some fun, make some jokes and enjoy life. The voice acting and facial animation must be commended as being amazing. Overall this game is an experience with enough challenge to attract people for a multiple playthroughs.",normal,ps4,2017-02-09,English,2,1,10,train

lorycastel,"An overvalued game.,I've ever wanted to try this game, reading the reviews it seemed one of the best Playstation games ever, an epic game with a truly touching story which could even make you cry; so finally, after three long years, I've bought it, taking the remastered version for my ps4.,First of all the graphics are good, being a remastered they're not as stunning as those in more recent games, but they are enjoyable and settings are breathtaking.,I love the idea of crossing the United States during a post-apocalyptic era surrounded by abandoned buildings, closed activities, soldiers and infected people everywhere. The gameplay is long enough and quite interesting, but I have to complain about the frequent bugs and the fact that the protagonist's allies, especially Ellie, the girl you have to carry with you during your journey, are often too close above all during fights and they could become an annoying obstacle:,for example they sometimes steal your covering or stay between you and the enemy not allowing you to shoot him, making you risk your health or life.,I love that you can upgrade guns, create bombs and aid kits by collecting tools, but in my opinion they are too rare and badly located (such as important tools put in dangerous areas full of enemies), so that at the end of the game you have barely get the 50% of things, especially pills which improve your skills aren't enough. Another annoying thing about it, is that if you die or want to restart from the last checkpoint, the game doesn't save the tools and objects you had picked up in the meanwhile, so you must re-collect them again.,Fights are quite difficult as stealth, despite being an alternative, is useless.,If an enemy (either a human being or an infected) finds you, even if he doesn't make any noise, all the others are inexplicably alerted and you're in great troubles. Stealth isn't well done at all.,Finally, the part which pushed me to try this game: the plot, the story.,I read it was captivating, brilliant.. well, not really.,I've played games which have a much more interesting story than this: Beyond two souls, Heavy rain, Life is strange for example.,Games in which you immediately put yourself in the main character's shoes: you feel all his anxieties, his fears, his worries, all his sensations. I even cried playing one of these games because it really touched my heart.,But The last of us has definitely let me down.,The idea is wonderful: a man who loses his little daughter during the start of the epidemics two decades before and then gets attached to a little girl who should just be a piece of contraband goods to him.,But it was written in a bad way. The first chapters, excluded the prologue, are totally plain, dull, sometimes even boring. The plot is almost non existent or too predictable. Then in the last three chapters it starts to be interesting and you can get involved. But just in the last 3/4 hours of gameplay.,In conclusion, I can describe it as a good game, it's worth your time and money, but it is absolutely overvalued since there are other ps games, usually undervalued, which give you a real captivating plot. But not this.,The last of us is a good game, Naughty Dog rarely falls, but not as amazing as everybody says.",normal,ps4,2017-02-05,English,0,0,8,train

DylanJHamilton,"The Last of Us was a masterpiece in 2013 and with this release in 2014, you get all of the goodies leftover from Naughty Dog with enhanced graphic and interaction. The FPS is absolutely amazing with the known concept of apocalyptic doom in which is an absolute masterpiece! The composition of the game is simply astonishing and groundbreaking. Gameplay never changed but enhanced as said before. The story is heartbreaking in which it gives you a hard GRIP of reality if there were an apocalypse. The concept of what caused this apocalypse in this story in which gives nobody any hope is absolutely what everyone looked for in a survival horror. I say this is THE best survival horror shooter EVER MADE in HISTORY. Beating out Left 4 Dead and Resident Evil 4 etc. This game is groundbreaking, beautiful and realistic. The characters are absolutely realistic and it gets rid of the rhetoric of question in women in video gaming as you take over as Ellie in the second to last level. Joel is an absolute example of a man who has lost everything who had to fight to get back everything he had. This journey changed him as well as it did in Ellie.,,This also comes with the DLC Left Behind where you take over as Ellie. This is enhanced as well and also amazing as it ties with the story. It also brings in diversity and understanding. People will be mad at some of Ellie's incapabilities but you have to understand the reality of a young girl trying to survive in a situation such as the DLC and the second to last Chapter in the game. There is serious potential in the future for a more powerful Ellie as a playable character bringing in the diversity for those who desire it.,,You are getting a full experience for an emotional and realistic journey in post apocalyptic America in The Last Of Us: Remastered.

As a remastered version The Last Of Us had pretty good graphics, albeit the character models, movements, acting and general world graphics still felt a bit out dated compared to Uncharted 4.

Regardless, I really enjoyed the game play, combat, crafting, voice acting, the grimness, the intensity of the puzzles and sneaking around.,,Overall I do recommend this game.

EspadaTiburon,"I played this game for the first time recently despite having a PS3. Never saw what the hype around this game was about and I never liked the Uncharted series, so Naughty Dog making it meant nothing to me. I finally gave it a try and sort of regret not playing it sooner. The game is fantastic. The story does a very good job of instilling emotion into the player and it's paced very well. To be honest, the game felt really short to me when I look at the time that I spent playing it. However, the pacing of the story and everything felt just right. Nothing felt rushed or dragged on. Length wise, I felt it was short, but I enjoyed every moment of it and really wouldn't change anything about the writing. This game is a masterpiece in terms of the story. The game is looks great and it's one of the best remasters of a last generation game. It runs great as well, unlike many other remasters that are quick cash grabs. The content definitely justifies the price of it. My only issue with this game is the combat and general gameplay of it. The combat is really nothing special. I found it sometimes a bit boring, to be honest. It's extremely solid, but does nothing really new and I felt it was just good, but nothing to write home about. The gameplay was definitely not clunky or had any massive flaws. Another issue I had was how annoying it would be with how you had to be in a exact spot. I remember during the game, going underwater to get a wooden raft. When I got close to it, it wouldn't let me interact with it. I had to get at a perfect distance from it in order to interact with it. This was really annoying because the interaction button only appeared for a second as I was swimming around and I almost missed it. This would lead me to just wander around randomly trying to figure out what to do to progress in the game. Aside from this issue, this game is definitely perfect. Would recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried the game before. I wasn't really sure what the hype was about before, but I can definitely see it now. It's worth all the praise and hype around it.",normal,ps4,2016-12-21,English,0,0,9,train

AceSeptre515,"I never wrote a review for this game, and with the recent announcement of The Last of Us Part 2, I went back for a replay to see how well the game stood the test of time being as the game is now three and a half years old. If I had to use one word to some up The Last of Us, that word would be Emotion. Naughty Dog has created a world so believable, so immersive, and absolutely frightening which is a feat unto itself. But its the characters that really make The Last of Us stand out as a true masterpiece of game design. It's not very often that you can connect with the characters of a video game on such a deep and interpersonal way. You feel deeply for the plight of Joel and Ellie. You understand the moral dilemma that they face in a way that even film producers have a hard time getting their audience to emotionalize. The perfect design of the post apocalyptic United States, paired with who in my opinion are the two greatest characters to ever be voiced in a video game along with a soundtrack that can bring tears to your eyes all on its own, and you really start to understand that Naughty Dog has done something special with The Last of Us. Since the original release on PS3 in July 2013 I have played completely through the game twelve times and it never once ceases to amaze. I still cry every time even though I know exactly what is going to happen. I still feel lost in the landscape despite the fact I know exactly where I am going. Another thing I think is absolutely worth mentioning about this game is that despite some very tense moments, you never feel pressured to perform. You don't have to play the game ""perfectly"", you don't have to master some inane set of skills to help you progress. All you have to do is sit back and play. I like to play the game at night in the darkest room in the house and just sit back and relax and allow myself to be complete transported into the world. If you are tired of first person shooters, tired of RPGs and overly gratuitous action in every video game you play then The Last of Us is worth every last bit of your time and money. If I had to make a list of three video games that were the only games I could play for the rest of my life, then The Last of Us would be near the top. Even if you only every play FPS games. Even if you only play JRPGs, heck...even if you only play card games, I suggest you play The Last of Us. Then, play it again.",normal,ps4,2016-12-11,English,2,1,10,train

I never wound up buying a Playstation 3 due to time and such, but I always wanted to after hearing just how phenomenal people thought it was.,,So I'm killing time in a Best Buy after going to the dentist before heading to work and I was browsing the Sony aisle. I asked if they had any deals on the Playstation 3, the first guy said no and that was about all he said. So another guy who works there overheard me and said that they were running a special on the PS4 today, he put Ratchet and Clank in my hand first, which I was thinking, ""Oh cool, I heard it's good."" Then he put The Last of Us Remastered in my hand and I had NO idea they remastered it - I haven't really played many video games in years.

Odogreviews,"I got the Last of Us around the time it came out but never managed to find the time to finish it. The game has amassed many accolades and awards from critics and is considered one of the greatest games of all time. I was finally able to find the time to finish it. The Last of Us even still in 2016 is one of the best PlayStation exclusives I have ever played. The Last of Us is an action survival game developed by Naughty Dog well know for the Uncharted series. Hearing that the game took place in a post-apocalyptic zombie setting my hopes went down. The post-apocalyptic zombie genre is beginning to get real stale and old. People have compared this game to the Walking Dead TV series that  I have no inclination in watching. For this review I will try to push aside all my views on the genre and focus instead on the game and explain why I am able to like this game but still not like the genre it is in.,The Last of Us was made a few years ago back in 2013 at the end of 7th console generation. I will be reviewing the remastered version on PS4 which looks surprisingly beautiful and breathtaking for a post-apocalyptic setting. Instead of creating a generic desert wasteland setting the Last of Us features a variety of unique environments from collapsed cities and suburbs where plants and nature are returning to flourish, stunning mountains full of trees rivers and wildlife to snowy locations up in the mountains. The graphics have also aged surprisingly well but do not look as impressive as some of the current 8th generation game engines. How well the graphics have held up his a testament to the fact that photo-realistic graphics can be just as stunning if not better than stylized ones.The game features limited types of enemies which include infected zombies and bandits and raiders and the occasional soldiers. I found the infected design better than most zombie designs because of the fact that they are infected by a fungal infection based off of the real life fungal infection that happens to insects called cordyceps. I found the zombie enemies still unexciting and uninspired and I felt they could have done more with the fungal infection theme. I find zombies a repetitive uninspired enemies that are too prevalent in the game industry. I found the raider encounters tense and exciting especially the encounters in the winter section of the game. Overall the Last of Us offers an impressive presentation that will not be forgotten excusing the boring zombie enemies.,Story wise the Last of Us tells an unforgettable story that  you will not forget. I found the story so enjoyable that I recommend playing this game for the story alone. The Last of Us stars the main characters of Joel and Ellie. I found them some of the most well developed characters in a video game period. I don’t want to spoil the story at all because it is that good. All I will say is that the game takes place during the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse in the U.S. The goal is to escort Ellie a 13 year old girl who is immune to the virus to the lab of the Fireflies a terrorist organization that fights against the now remaining U.S. government which has become militarized. The story will keep you on edge as you watch Ellie and Joel travel across the country trying to survive. By the end of the game you will gripping your controlling hoping that Ellie and Joel can make it out alive. My favorite character by far is Ellie and I found her to be entertaining, sympathetic, and funny all at the same time. I found the ending satisfying and encompasses the tone of the game.,The Last of Us offers fun innovative gameplay that helps add to game's narrative and graphics. The Last of Us uses the standard survival gameplay system. The game uses stealth and a crafting system where combat is done with an over the shoulder perspective. The game also has the occasional boss fights as well. The gameplay is nothing to write home about yet its simplicity is its beauty. The gameplay allows the player to experience the story and atmosphere without being interrupted. I found the melee combat nice and crunchy and allows the player to feel every painful brutal attack you give to each enemy. The gameplay adds to brutal nature of the story by having the player engage in guerilla warfare by having the player use handcrafted weapons and basic firearms. I did find some weapons unnecessary such as the flamethrower and automatic weapons. They take away from the survival nature of the combat and turn it into a generic over the shoulder shooter like most games. The Last of Us delivers in making tense survival gameplay that will keep entertained throughout the game.,,The Last of Us is an essential game that should be played by all Playstation users. The game features atmospheric realistic environments and crafts a story that is so excellent it will be remembered long after finishing the game. The survival gameplay is great but does not quite measure up to the game’s story and atmosphere. I believe that there will never be such a thing as a perfect game but the Last of Us comes extremely close. The game has a few flaws such as the long load times and zombie enemies which I found simplistic compared to the game’s great story and characters. Despite the fact that I do not like the zombie apocalypse genre, I found that The Last of Us a masterpiece. When I finished the game and saw the credits roll I realized that the game was not about the zombies but the human drama instead and what people will do to protect the ones they love.,,10/10: Masterpiece",normal,ps4,2016-11-17,English,2,1,10,test

XavierLaws,"""I've struggled a long time with survivin', but no matter what you have to find something to fight for"" Joel The Last of Us. What do you fight for when all is lost? where do you go when there is no where safe to go?,,The last of us remastered is an excellent survival horror game that is set in Boston. The game takes the main two protagonist Joel and Ellie across the United States to find a cure to a fungal disease that has crippled the entire U.S. population and have turned them into zombies. This is a game I could easily recommend to anyone looking to play a good game with an amazing story. I found that the game developers did a great job on the games fully fleshed out main protagonists and their relationship as the story progresses. The music choice is yet another great feature, along with the great art style.

HTGamer,"The Last of Us is one of the greatest games ever made. It's that simple. Unlike other great games that have aged badly, The Last of Us is still highly enjoyable to play today, more than 3 years after it originally came out on PS3.,,The story is about Joel and teenager Ellie, who embark on a personal journey. This isn't about some cliche' marines single-handedly saving the world without a sweat, it's about ordinary people trying to survive another day in a post-apocalyptic world, 20 years after an infection ravaged the world. Across their journey they will face many obstacles and challenges, along with other characters, both benevolent and malevolent. Enemies are both humans and zombies (""infected""). The story is beautiful and personal, and culminates in one of the best ending dialogues in gaming history. You 'll also enjoy little details like Ellie trying to learn how to whistle, wondering about the world before the apocalypse (she sees a fashion ad and says ""why girls were so skinny back then?""), or telling silly jokes to Joel by reading her joke book.,,Also included in the game is the DLC Left Behind, which is a prequel to the main game's story. It's not just a small dose of the Last of Us, it's somewhat different, as it is more story-focused and light-hearted fun, and action takes a back seat. Since Ellie hasn't many guns and is weak physically, she has to either avoid enemies (humans and zombies) or make them battle between themselves. To help play through, it is mixed with a bit of gameplay and story from the main game, meaning that Left Behind is a memory of Ellie. But it is strongly advised that Left Behind should be played AFTER completing the main game.,,Gameplay is great. The game is about survival and resource management, because these are scarce in a post-apocalyptic world. You have just a few bullets, and there are a few collectibles to pick up and craft items such as healing packs and molotov cocktails, which can be done at any moment. The game is linear in its structure, but most of the levels are open enough to take advantage of multiple routes, multiple levels, or distracting enemies by throwing bottles. There are also the occasional puzzles, but nothing too difficult.,,The multiplayer suite included is fantastic and original. It's slower paced, like the main game, and you have to take down enemies while hiding, making no noise (because by running you are detected more easily), and collecting resources for your virtual clan. There is a variety of maps and modes, but the main point is to just survive through to the end of 2 campaigns, by completing missions (or rather challenges).,,Graphics are beautiful in an artistic sense, but not great technologically, since the game was originally developed for the PS3. The remaster work by Naughty Dog cleans up the image and doubles the frame rate to 60 fps, but the game is still a previous-gen one. Sound-wise, both the voice acting and the minimalist but haunting soundtrack are great.,,All in all, no gamer should overlook The Last of Us. It's a must buy.

blakfayt,"The Last of Us is, quite honestly, an 8/10. Most people go on and on about the story and how touching it was, how much they felt, and the story is actually the weakest part of the game. TLoU tells the story of a cliche single father whose daughter predictably dies inside of ten minutes without the player really knowing either of them, and we're supposed to care because she was his daughter. He then finds a replacement daughter 20 years later and that's about it. Naughty Dog themselves even said the entire game was built around Joel and Ellie's father/daughter relationship. And that was a stupid decision.,,The game, at certain points, suggests two VASTLY MORE INTERESTING stories, Joel's life in the post apocalypse as a smuggler, and his adventures with his brother shortly after the outbreak. Instead we get a typical ""Father tries to connect with his step daughter on a road trip"" Hollywood story, told in a kind of dark setting. The few times we actually do something other than be cliche are far apart and don't last long. The ending is also very predictable and didn't surprise me in the slightest.,,Where the game really shines is in combat. Shooting things is good, the stealth is difficult but rewarding (and infuriating, but we'll get to that), overall it flows very well. The mixed gameplay is fun to mess around with, and I'm a total sucker for exploration that gives me upgrades, and crafting. There's enough variety for each player to make their own style in combat. Personally, I got addicted to throwing smoke bombs after kiting enemies into one area and then molotoving them and shotgunning the stragglers.,,There are faults in the system, however. There are enemies that kill you instantly that are very difficult to distinguish from a distance from ... literally any other enemy. You have to either stealth kill these guys, or spend quite a few bullets (in the early game) to take them out. This leads to incredibly frustrating areas where two or more are in close proximity, and since they use sound instead of sight, sneaking up on two in the same room is nigh impossible without serious shenanigans. The game also drops the ""ammo is scarce! Use it wisely!"" around the middle of the game unless you're playing on one of the much harder difficulties. Naughty Dog, again, have explicitly stated that TLoU uses some kind of ammo counter, and while you won't get every shot back after a fight, the enemies are programmed to drop enough for survival in the next area, which is generally more than enough. I cleared the game my first time through with more handgun rounds than I could use in a single fight. They also obnoxiously lock simple minded ""skills"" behind high walls. One of the most useful skills you can purchase allows you to save yourself if grabbed by a zombie by stabbing them. I don't know about you, but I don't need training on how to shove a sharp object into something that's trying to strangle me. It seems quite obvious really, and only serves to hide the more useful ability behind it on the upgrade tree.,,Despite those few flaws, the game is quite enjoyable. The story is fun enough the first time through, if predictable, and the voice acting really makes the characters pop. The graphics are good, though I wish we could have seen more of cities coated in mushrooms growing everywhere, give us the sense that the fungus was taking over. But most importantly, shooting guys is fun. Sneaking up on them is challenging but fun. Those are the most important things. The game is FUN to play. Too many people get hung up on the story and completely miss that the controls are smooth easy to understand, combat is challenging but rewarding, and the systems incorporated in the game make exploration worth doing. If there's one thing I hope for in The Last of Us 2 I hope they make the environments bigger and give us more things to craft and upgrade. But, maybe make the skill upgrades something that would need upgraded instead of simple self defense that a child could do.",normal,ps4,2016-07-18,English,0,0,8,train

Let me start with the story, It is rich and exotic the characters actually feel alive and everything they do to what they think can be a serious note. In this game you are the remnants of a large virus epidemic that turns people into flesh eating zombie-like monsters. If i were to use a TV show for this comparison i would say The Walking Dead! The plot is great with some twist and turns oh and if you don't do that QTE expect a gory scene to come from there after thanks to the graphics engine the game is able to express the devastation and detail of life after civilization collapsed. This game just gets everything right so anyway anyone tries to use the outbreak for their own gain is demonstrated and most of the time gives you the option to play the hero. The gameplay however is different then almost any game think of it as Dark Soul's difficulty compared to an FPS it is that good. Due to supplies being scarce it is up to you to find ammo and weapons and use them at appropriate times or face an unfortunate end. You are always in constant danger from infected and from hostile human beings. The third person view seems most appropriate and gives it an Uncharted like style with out the Uncharted feel.  The game mixes lots of emotions it could get very dark at times, funny or just plain depressing but that is why you play it and it feels true to it's name in addition the games price currently is excellent The Last of Us constantly won game of the year and it is deserving of it %100.

It is full of moments in gameplay and cut scenes that I will always remember and always resonate with me, wether it be moments of extreme sorrow, horror, joy, tension, or anger. this one of the most well crafted narratives ever made, if not the most. what really brings this game home for me though is how its gameplay is equally enthralling, always tense and surprisingly engaging and deeper than the surface would suggest, I couldn't find a single flaw in the game, perhaps for a few nitpicks with how certain gameplay moments such as using a plank to bring Elli across water gets used a few times but that's really reaching.

During my time as a Xbox player I stumbled into one of my friends and he looked pretty tired; black around the eyes and not the best of hair days (you know the look). He told me he'd been up playing a game that was too good. ""Too good"". I like that, I thought. I immediately became fascinated of what kind of game he was talking about and he just said ""The Last Of Us"".,,This was back in 2013 and I was still split screening Gears of War but I never forgot about that title. So when I bought my PS4, a year and a half later, they recommended a free game to it - Watch Dogs or Destiny. There weren't loads of new PS4 titles out in the initial phase of the new consoles so I took Watch Dogs since I've longed for that title too but just before I exited the store I saw it - The Last of Us Remastered. I broke my budget and left in a hurry. I came home and started Watch Dogs. Played a couple of hours and got bored. And usually I play one game at a time, but this time I made an exception...,,Since that day the Last of Us is the best game I've played. The feeling, the story, the animations, everything. The only thing that was bad was a pretty bad pixled squirrel that jumps onto a car during one cutscene. I mean, this is a game that's better than most movies. It's pure art.

It's a bad game, but a good experience, overall its managed to still be propped up by that, but I'd never want to play through it again.,,The character movement is very stiff, a lot of the times you're left wondering why you cannot jump up places or squeeze through gaps. So most of the gameplay revolves around finding alternative routes, usually by finding a wooden pallet for Ellie, giving a boost up or finding a ladder. It really becomes tiresome, especially since you can see a big gap in the object that has fallen over, that for some reason the game decides would be impossible to get through.,,I just found myself through all the Infected and shooting scenes, just saying to myself ""alright we'll just get past this to get to the story"".

The ideas for the ""upgraded"" clickers and bloaters is absolutely amazing and very creative. These kind of creative additions to the already loved zombie franchise are what make The Last of Us such an incredible game.,Along with the amazing creativity comes an amazing game-play. The entire game kept my attention and was really hard to put down due to all of the events that are constantly unraveling. There’s a very comfortable balance of emotionally damaging moments, most of which come from Ellie and Joel’s father-daughter relationship developing and progressing, and action-filled fighting sequences. Speaking of fighting sequences, I loved the parts where you got to fight non-infected people. The amount of thought into each and every character, even the guards or assassins that you only see once before you kill them, is absolutely insane and makes the game one hundred times more addictive. Characters can be tricky to develop correctly, especially in video games, but the creators of The Last of Us nailed each and every character completely.,Overall, the game-play was amazing and intense with hardly any boring moments and was able to keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Not knowing what was going to pop out at me every five seconds was a very fun experience. The story line was impeccable, the graphics were nothing less than exquisite, and the originality was definitely there.

Though it didn't reach the 'best game ever' status that a lot of people have given it, it is a very, very good game.,,The soundtrack is immense and memorable, the graphics are hugely improved from what were already incredible graphics on the PS3, as Joel and Ellie become instantly relateable thanks to their realistic look, as well as some of the best voice acting you will hear in video games. Naughty Dog never disappoints when it comes to that aspect of games. The story of the game is so realistic it will invest anyone who plays it, the fact that the bacteria and disease involved is a real thing that does not effect humans at the moment does make the player wonder, could this actually happen?,,On the other hand, the gameplay does disrupt The Last of Us in my opinion. You will go from shooting humans that they put in front of you, to sneaking through a pack of clickers, to trying to escape from something, rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat. There is never huge variation in the gameplay, and with the shooting being particularly slow, it does not help the game at all. The Last of Us suffers from the same problems I felt Uncharted suffered from, in such a beautiful world there is never any room for exploration. Couldn't you just let us wander just a little? Damn you Naughty Dog.,,Multiplayer is quite gripping, however it doesn't really keep up with what the story was about, but it is entertaining none the less.

fluxmulder,"Let's not pretend this is an innovative and groundbreaking game, because its not. TLOU is your basic Walking Dead episode made into a game. You got your clickers (zombies), post-apocalyptic America, the last remnants of humanity fighting for survival, and all the ""tough"" and ""gut wrenching"" situations and story beats that you'd expect from this genre. You play generic gruff white guy Joel, and the intolerably precocious Ellie. ND claims that wanted to break molds with the characters, but at the end of the day, you're playing yet another white guy, protecting a damsel in distress. The gameplay: it sucks. This is not a fun game. Very clumsy 3rd person shooter with lots of realism mechanics thrown in, like staggering when you get hit, limited ammo, and spastic enemy animations that make it hard to hit them. There's some lazy stealth thrown in, which consists of you shuffling around cover and being told you are hidden, even though the top of your head is clearly visible to the AI. There's some crafting and a small skill tree thrown into the mix, but they don't add much. Other games have done it before, and in a more fun way. This game was one huge chunk of Oscar-bait. Everything about it screams ""look at us, we're so thought provoking and serious"". It feels forced and unnatural, like they want their game to be considered art.

There are a few small complaints as to why doesn't the bushes or grass even budge when interacting with them, but it doesn't take away from the great overall scenery.,,The character development is fantastic, showing both Joel And Ellie feeling a great range of emotions both about the situation and their pasts. Naughty Dog sets up a great world for this to set up, with not as much as I would of liked for exploration as most areas are pretty liner but I guess that why games like Day Z exist. Both the interactions with the infected and humans feel intense. There was a section of the game where I wont go too much into detail not to spoil it, but I had sneaked around all the infected to come to a door that was blocked. You had to move the object which made a lot of noise attracting the whole room and got my heart racing. I had no idea if I was going to make it out of the room or not. This game is filled with these moments, and also filled with moments where you and Ellie are out in a field and talk about something. The game does a great job in building both characters up.,,Also this game comes with the Left Behind DLC, which is a great addition as both a prequel and some information that happens during the main game.,,The only other complaint I had was with some of the AI. There was stealth sections where you would barley move just to sneak up on your attacker, not making a single noise just for them to quickly spin around and start shooting like they had heard you or seen you. This doesn't happen often, but it always resulted in a death for me as I was playing on a harder difficulty.,,Other then that, this is a masterpiece of a game. Anyone who loves story and character driven games and obviously owns a PS3 or PS4, this is a must buy.",normal,ps4,2016-03-15,English,0,0,10,train

K-Crow,"The Last of Us is a truly beautiful game brought to us by an amazingly talented developer (Naughty Dog) who are also known for their Uncharted game franchise. The single-player story mode is where this game shines and where most of the work was put in on this game. With stunning graphics, near-perfect voice acting and motion capture performances, this game truly does feel like a movie, mostly because of it's deep characters and the realistic dialogue they share. The thing that truly makes this game beautiful is how well the game play of the single-player compliments it's deep story line. With many interesting and fun yet simple featuresmechanics that truly add to the game play and add some fun replay value, the game play is no way dragged out in the slightest and knows when to slow down to switch to a cut scene for some story exposition. While that is where most of ""The Last of Us""'s content lies, the multiplayer is nothing to sneeze at either. Most certainly differing far from any other game out there. It can get very competitive and is a blast to play with friends. It isn't perfect with a few noticeable balancing issues and not much content to delve into between matches. However, this game truly deserves high praise for it's beautiful, emotional and intelligent plot.",normal,ps4,2016-02-29,English,0,0,10,train

M_2_K,"STORY,The storyline of the Last of Us is actually more dense and interesting than the blurb of its box initially implies. You'll play as Joel, a middle-aged man who makes his living by smuggling and exchanging in a series of often dangerous deals, to earn ration cards for survival. Sourced by the leader of the infamous milita group, the 'Fireflies', Joel and accomplice Tess are offered a desirable reward in exchange for transporting a young girl from point A to B (no questions asked). After Joel's reluctant acceptance, you begin to make your way through the overgrown and dead streets of America - most of which have been reclaimed by the Infected, who take increasingly threatening forms depending on the time they have spent with said infection. As the story begins to unfold, some of the most exciting and enjoyable plot points in gaming history take shape.,,GAMEPLAY,If the Last of Us was intended to feel like a true survival game, its remit has been fulfilled admirably in this case. You start from the very bottom, and the way you engage your enemies is tailored depending on your supplies. The game is relentless- if you run out of your bullets on your handgun, you will be forced to choose an alternate manner to clear your enemies, else rely on crafted bombs, melee weapons (which do have a short life) or anything else you may pick up. While your arsenal should expand as the game progresses, at many points I found myself having to resort to picked up bricks due to a lack of ammo in virtually all my weapons. I truly felt the struggle for survival. In a good way.,,GRAPHICS,Stunning. Perfect. Naughty Dog. I cannot fault the visuals. Stunning character models. Remastered beautifully for the PS4 (but there was not much to improve, mind you, as it pushed last-gen PS3 to its limits.),,VERDICT (10/10),The Last of Us is with out a shadow of a doubt the best game of our time. Its beautiful narration perfectly compliments the relatable, flawed (yet witty) characters who inhabit the visually unmatched post-pandemic America.

The writing, acting, graphics, sound, and gameplay all coalesce to create an unparalleled gaming experience, which some would say is even transformative.  By successfully inviting players to emotionally invest and care deeply about its characters, their relationships, and their choices, the Last of Us triumphs where many games with stellar production values fall short.  As mainly a PC gamer who has thoroughly enjoyed games such as Mass Effect 2, the original Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and Knights of the Old Republic, I have to go back to Thief: The Dark Project, a PC game from 1998, to remember when I cared so deeply about the fate of a game protagonist (Garrett in this case).,,Simply put:  If playing an amazing story is of interest to you (and you don't mind a post-apocalyptic/zombie bent), you owe yourself the favor of experiencing this game.

ricklongo,"There are often times when I can't, for the life of me, understand why everyone in the western part of our world drools over a particular game. I believe there's no better example for this as The Last of Us, a title that got tens all around and was praised for its supposedly incredible storyline. Even though I had experienced several sections of the game on a friend's PS3, the PS4 was my first chance to try it for real, and I walked away sorely unimpressed.,,First of all, I fully admit to getting kind of worried whenever a title gets praised more for its story than its actual gameplay. It's the latter that will always matter the most in a game for me, and in this regard The Last of Us is passable at best, extremely forgettable at worst. It consists of a series of linear, quick-time-event-heavy, cover-based shooting stages that get repetitive really fast, with only mild incentives for any kind of exploration.,,Even though the game does feature a lot of actual cutscenes, its gameplay sections are made in such a way that main character Joel is always talking and interacting with other people somehow. I admit I can see how some people would enjoy this playable-movie vibe, but it's definitely not my thing. Often I would just get annoyed when a cutscene would end, just because I knew it meant I'd have to start actually playing. This made me start holding the opinion that The Last of Us would be better suited as, you know, an actual movie rather than a game.,,Speaking of which: yeah, there's a cool story here, with some well-written emotional gut-punches. But unlike what I've read around the web, it's absolutely nowhere near the level of the true storytelling masterpieces of our time, from A Song of Ice and Fire to Breaking Bad to The Sopranos (and yes, I've seen comparisons to all of those). Maybe that's because the script just feels like a known quantity in the time we live in: it has a post-apocalyptic setting (check), a hardened man getting to terms with his own emotions (check), zombie-thingies (check), dialogue sections filled with wise cracks that aren't all that fresh (check). It was just too 'been there, done that' for me, even with the emotional turns, and as a result I never really felt the father-daughter relationship between the main characters as apparently most people have.,,It may be one of those cases in which a game is just not for me, especially because I fully admit I've never been that interested in post-apocalyptic settings and its tropes. Still, just trying to analyse The Last of Us from a detached standpoint, I fail to see why it's had such an extremely enthusiastic reception. I wouldn't say it's a flat-out bad game, but there are numerous realistic-style titles with more fluid and satisfying gameplay, there are numerous non-games with better stories, and it is my honest opinion that this is not one of those cases in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.,,I think this is the kind of game that everyone should at least try, if only just to see what the fuss is all about. If your gaming tastes are anywhere close to mine, however, you'll probably get entertained for a while, then start seriously considering just searching for a cutscene compilation on Youtube instead.,,Rating: 5.5",normal,ps4,2015-11-28,English,7,5,5,train

It has some mature themes that no game would dare touch on, it has some heart-breaking moments that will get you really emotional; expect to cry or feel terrible at least once.  But one of the key elements to The Last of Us is Ellie.  Ellie is by far one of the most realistic characters in any game ever made, her reactions, the way she acts is unlike any video game heroine.  The combat is fluid, having to manage your resources while keeping yourself alive.  The online multiplayer is really fun as well, the Last Man Standing mode captures the game's feel.

vaughtex,"With a game that has so much critical acclaim the past few weeks, it’s easy to get caught up in the hype. The opening section of the game is a tense and brilliantly realised outbreak of the “virus”, after this outstanding introduction you are plunged into generic, broken cities – climbing up fire escapes, sneaking in dark abandoned buildings and shooting / shivving “the infected”, who stagger about like a drunk uncle at a party. The environments are populated with textures and graphics that have seemingly been recycled from Naughty Dog’s other work (Uncharted, notably – the same red bricks, the same broken cars, same furniture). It does look impressive though, the lighting and shadows are particularly stunning in parts.,Wandering around, crouched to reduce noise and detection, before sneaking up on an enemy is well trodden ground by now, as a result the gameplay style is instantly familiar and generic, its hard to find much to be impressed by early on in the game. I found myself plodding through the campaign for a few hours, not entirely certain whether I was enjoying the experience or not, but regardless eager to see where the whole thing was headed.,,Mercifully, the game changes pace when you encounter the Human enemies, which will stop at nothing to hunt you down rather than saunter around like the infected. This makes a more menacing and challenging experience, akin to the manhunt franchise.,,Whilst playing the game I couldn’t help think what the game developers could have done with certain sections. At times it feels like the environments were under used. It wasn’t until about 8 hours in it dawned on me that maybe the omission of more “jumpy”, edge of your seat scares, were perhaps deliberate. It isn’t a typical survival horror game, it is a bleak, miserable and hopeless journey of two people, the enemies are merely incidental antagonists all trying to survive.,I was only harking back to typical conventions of horror video games because that is what I expected to see, because that is all I have seen in the past.,As a result, the tearing up of the rulebook means that it reveals itself after about 5 hours as a refreshing experience. Sure, there are some clichéd and terribly contrived sections of games of yore, particularly pushing boxes to climb up onto roofs and walking through dimly lit sewers – but it never cheapens the experience with overly obvious encounters with a slew of bad guys, or unnecessary fetch and find puzzles. It certainly makes up for the lackluster, first few hours of the game.,,Arguably, the most significant and important aspect of the game is the storyline and characters. Last of us certainly stands out from the crowd here. Traditionally video games have terrible writing and poor characterization. Not here, the writing is so accomplished you actually care about the characters backstories and plight. It’s like watching a TV show where you want to know what happens next. I really hope other developers take note of this accomplishment and up their game (no pun intended). The games storyline gradually develops using great pacing, the final quarter of the game is particularly malevolent and completely gripping. It can be an emotional, sometimes harrowing experience; no video game from recent memory has left me with my mouth open in amazement, or given me a level of emotional response like The Last of Us has.",normal,ps4,2015-11-22,English,0,0,9,train

Brainache,"This is a reasonable single player game but it is let down by the fact that many of the levels are obviously designed for multiplayer and the multiplayer itself. The story is great and the game enjoyable on normal difficulty but it is extremely frustrating on the highest difficulty for anyone aiming for the platinum trophy or achievement completion. The multiplayer on the other hand is a visceral and unrewarding experience and not one that I found enjoyable in the slightest. The various events that can wipe out your accumulated survivors unless certain criteria are met are just ridiculous, but for me, the executions are just too much to handle. The multiplayer is dominated by veterans and the matchmaking always seems to throw a few into the game on each side. Weapon upgrades are lost with each new round so each match seems to reduce to gathering enough supplies to buy upgrades or make items in order to stand a chance. I've only the two online trophies to get but grinding for them has just ruined the whole experience of this game.

Gloone,"On an artistic level, it's unparalleled. The story, writing and voice acting are all leagues beyond any other game I've played. The two lead characters are charismatic and masterfully developed throughout the course of the game. The music and visuals brilliantly evoke a world with a heady atmosphere of quiet sadness and loneliness. As to the gameplay, many people consider it a weaker aspect, but I found the approach to combat to be original and far more challenging and engaging than other action games. The very limited supplies and powerful enemies mean that every confrontation is consequential, and thus genuinely nerve-racking. There are periods of planning, of nervous tension, and of wild improvisation. I can only think of two criticisms. The first is that these confrontations, along with scavenging, constitute 95% of the gameplay -- some variation in the fundamental style of play from time to time would have been welcome. Secondly, the AI sometimes leaves something to be desired. Allies can get in the way and fatally mess things up; enemies can act in stupid ways making them too easy, such as walking repeated paths or forgetting where you are and searching nonsensical places; and sometimes the enemies can have inconsistent and confusing behaviours, such as detecting where you are when all you did was make a loud distraction elsewhere. These issues are not frequently a large problem though; the gameplay is generally smooth and polished. All in all a very strong 9/10.

I have been playing games since I can remember, but this game... was one of my best experiences I have ever had in past 20 years or so, not only in games but also in films! You can't, not think about it as a god damn, top notch film, even with its amazing gameplay. After the game, I was sitting and looking at the menu screen, listening to the amazing soundtrack, and trying to pull myself together, after this emotional journey... I would love to describe it, but I can't... You have to scavenge, survive and live through it on your own... Only then, you can see the unbelievable level of accomplishment this game has achieved. The only thing I would change, would be the difficulty. I have finished the game on the maximum difficulty(grounded), and I believe this should be the only option. If you are reading this before playing it, trust me and do yourself a favour, play it on GROUNDED level. Every arrow, every bullet and other junk, will become the greatest treasure and asset of your playstyle and tactic. It will make it as realistic as possible, you will fear every dark place, noise and every enemy can be your last encounter if handled improperly. I have watched the ""making of"" afterwards, and seeing some of the gameplay in it, made me realised, how much of the real experience people are missing by choosing the easier options... Developers made it really fair, with a little thinking and few tries, you can make it, overcome the impossible. It's about the survival in a post-apocalyptic world where death awaits behind every corner, don't make a point and click game for kids out of it... Anyways, after almost 28 hours of the emotional roller-coaster, it is so hard to shake it off... The ending was great, I am fully satisfied with it.

MaximumD,"This is basically how this game was made. Bunch of people went into the boardroom and decided they will make a walking/murder simulator and then attach a story about the beauty and frailty of human life to it. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get into that when I've just murdered about 500 faceless guys, who apparently are just trying to get by like everyone else. Oh the girl is the innocent one, I get it. Nope, you murder about 50 people with her too at some point. I like the gameplay, it's smooth and the AI is decent, but it gets old after doing the same old crap for the entire game. All you do slowly walk to an area, watch a cutscene, murder about 15 guys either via sneak kills or just flat out beating their skulls in, and then repeat.,,Yeah, graphics are good and the base gameplay is solid, but I'm sorry the story is so overrated and the game gets real boring fast. Not to mention the plank sections that are just annoying, preventing you from continuing the walking simulator portion of the game. Which just takes you  to the next area to murder about 50 dudes. It deserves a decent score because of the production values and polished gameplay, which eventually just gets old. Oh and a bonus for an awesome online mode. The online mode is actually the true gem of this product. Sorry, but overall, way overrated. Online makes it a 7 instead of a 6.",normal,ps4,2015-07-28,English,6,5,7,train

lightyears,"Good game with unfortunately also some negative aspects. It has a great story and characters. Graphics are impressive and in-game sounds are among the best ever. But the game is also very linear. For me that is something of the past. The new chapter in game development are games where own decisions change story and lead to different endings (like Witcher 3). Where you have an open world to freely explore. Where you can leave the main quest to go for side quests. Where you have multiple ways to solve problems. Unfortunately the Last of Us doesnt deliver this. It is extremely linear. You have no real choices to make. But have to do anything the way the game developers want you to do it. That said, its still one of the best linear RPG's of the last years. Altough the quality of gameplay varies during the game. For the greatest part the atmosphere is really impressive. The virtual world looks great. The graphics are very good and the sounds are incredible. Unfortunately there are also moments that the gameplay gets annoying. Espesially during a lot of action, the controls are not always optimal. And by the way: in some parts of the game throwing a bottle towards your enemies is much more effective than shooting with a gun. So the next time you encounter a bear or a tiger in your real life leave your gun in your bag and just throw a bottle at it and you will be wonderfully fine. (Sarcasm) So the game does have its flaws. But for the greatest part its still an impressive experience. However for me the linear story and some annoying moments dont make it worth a 95 score. I say its worth 80 on a 100 point scale.",normal,ps4,2015-07-19,English,1,0,8,train
Sunykamey,"TLOU is a very good game at its core but stumbles over gameplay mechanics. The AI battles (be it human or infected) get repetitive fast. They almost ever require you to decoy-takedown-sneakpast. I understand the great ratings this game gets and they are well deserved (atmosphere, graphic, voice acting, story telling are among the best) but the game isn't flawless. The best parts of the game are when there are no encounters with anything, in this moments it shines. But beware if you get fast bored of repetitive gameplay (meaning scenarios that play out - at their core - exactly the same and there is no denying that a change of scenery doesn't change that drastically) then you have to decide for yourself if the rest of the game is worth the effort. For me it still is, but I can't play this game more than an hour every session (still want to finish it).",normal,ps4,2015-07-14,English,0,0,7,train

Desi101don,"This game should be only be praised for its gorgeous graphics and absolutely mind-blowing depressing story. This was my first time playing the last of us so I can't really completely compare between the previous and the remastered one.,,First I will be talking about the story. It is mind-blowing campaign as it engages you in the aftermath of the zombie breakout(the most over used cliché) which forces the people into the law of the jungle which is ""only the fittest will survive"" who kill each other for food and ammunition. You will be able explore those kinds of people through a protagonist who is survivor who even kills people to survive. All of the characters in the story are flawless you cannot nitpick anything about them. Eventhough the characters want the same thing( to survive) there is always something different about them which the game explores in depth. The only thing I thought the story could improve on is multiple decisions or even multiple endings if they put more time in and more effort. Eventhough they put a lot effort into this game. The game can be interactive but quite limited,,Now the actual gameplay. The gameplay does suffer a few flaws. The cons is the listen mode which you can turn off but once used its impossible not to use it again. The listen mode is basically finding where your enemies are which completely ruin the tension on finding your enemies. And killing them them in stealth very easily.But makes the game a bit strategic though. There isn't anything unique about the enemies at all but the clickers in my opinion are awesome( which is the only unique enemy). The AI can be predictable as you trace their tracks. But when it comes to your companion (yes , you will have a companion) they will actually help you defeat your enemies properly which make the game more realistic. You will also often fail due to your death or your companion's death. So in exchange for their help you will often have to help them as well. Exploration in this beautiful environment will be awarded (note-its not an open world game) as you will be given ammunition and crafting components. I found it quite addictive doing this. The ammunition is limited which makes sense since its a survival horror and a range of guns to use. There is also a crafting system which allow you to make realistic items. You can unlock new abilities as well. You can also upgrade your guns however you cannot simply press the option menu to upgrade it. Instead you have to go to specific areas where you will be able to upgrade your guns etc. In my opinion I wish this game like Dishonored have gameplay freedom where you could choose how you wanted to play since this is story-driven game. There is combat and it looks great. Every time you try to hit it someone it is always unique,,Final verdict: Outstanding story and flawless characters but with a good gameplay with a few flaws which make it less satisfying. I would have given this game a 7/10 due to the unsatisfying gameplay but I could't ignore the engaging story at all thus lead to my decision of a 8/10",normal,ps4,2015-07-07,English,1,0,8,train
Fantise1,"As a huge fan of the Uncharted series and other Naughty Dog games, I was pleased to find that the Last of Us is easily one of the greatest games of all time. The story could easily rival some of Hollywood's greatest works and the game play, while not really creative or 'new,' is enticing and terrifying. The AI might not be perfect (especially the partner AI) and some of the melee combat seems forced and awkward. However, the overall package is amazing. The story may have a good amount of zombie cliches, but because of how the story is portrayed (through incredible voice acting and one of the best visually stunning games) is what makes the story is endearing. The ending may not feel complete, but in a way, the world that the game portrays is not complete. The ending is bittersweet and fits the tone of the game amazingly. All in all, The Last of Us is a beautiful game and if you have already played the game on the PS3, it is worth it to revisit the game on the PS4.

Optimus-Prime,"The best story driven game I have ever played. The visuals, music, writing and voice acting had me invested in characters that felt real. For once I didnt feel like some overpowered superhero that could kill hundreds of infected without breaking a sweat like most post-apocalyptic games. Instead, on the hardest difficulties, I had to plan my approaches, scavenge and craft my way through and pick my battles. Gameplay mechanics work well although some stealth sections can feel slightly repetitive but a great balance between these sections and action packed shoot-outs make them bearable. Multiplayer requires  team based coordination and strategy that is refreshing from most 'lone wolf' all guns blazing style multiplayers that crowd the market. However, matches do tend to become one sided if someone decides to go it alone and ends up getting killed or if someone goes AFK.,,In conclusion, there is no doubt this game is a 'must have'.

Kaprawiec,"After seeing ale the 10/10 and game of the Year awards I was realli intrigued whats all the fuss about. So lets se what do we have here.,1) Story - another zombie flick. If this story was presented as a movie it would recieve average scores in about 7/10. Maybe a bit more but nobody with brain wouldnt give it 10 out of 10. So lets look elsewhere for the game of the year factor.,2) Gameplay - Nathan Drake is back! Wait, its not Nathan but he sure does look a lot like him, moves like him, shoots like him, fight like him. So in general it is him but in another setting and with different goals. The whole ""uncharted"" gameplay is not bad, but nothing new or special. We got stealth. This is NOT MGS, stealth is quite broken for me. I completed the game on hard and I was frustrated when enemies saw me when they werent supposed to. Whats funny they dont see my companions running like a fools and almost bumping into them. Very realistic. We also can craft things and upgrade weapons (which is quite ok) but we all saw that elsewhere and it was done better elsewhere. Whats worse, we got lots of fights. Figths that are not as fun as they should be. I was tired of seeing another horde of humans/infected attacking me again and again. At the end of the story I was wondering who killed more humans - plague or Joel... This was very anticlimatic for me. I liked the exploration part more than the fighting and the game would be better if Naughty Dog didnt throw so much enemies at us.,So from me gameplay is solid 8/10 - quite good but glithed and not as fun as it could be - definitely not a game of the year gameplay.,3) Visuals/Music - Graphics are nice, clean with quite a few good looking sceneries. Animation is also really good. But that damn corridors. We got Year 2015. You cant expect somebody to be amazed by graphics in AAA title where You move through damn corridors. How stupid can it get - You go into the wood and gues what? Youre in a corridor. The objective is to go to the bridge. On the way there are enemies. No, You cant go around them, BECAUSE YOURE IN A F***IN CORRIDOR!!! This is just dumb.,But wait - this is the best game on PS3 according to critics and players. So... lets grab an axe and try to hack the table to pieces. Nothing. Lets break window with a brick. Nothing! But the axe itself is made from glass i guess because it gets broken after 4 slashes. Damn... Ok I guess I want to much (but again - game of the year...I could destroy almost everything in enviroment in Black on PS2... over 10 years ago...). Fair score for the graphics is 7+/10.,,As You can see this is NOT the best game I played and in my opinion all of You who gave this game easy 10/10 for touching story - You probably wouldnt do that if it was a movie, or the book. So unfortunatelly this show that the gaming industry in terms of storytelling is far behind other entertainment sources.,And thats why the most important thing in games is gameplay. I hope I explained in details why the score this 8 out of 10 and why I rate simple games that base on excellent gameplay like geometry wars higher than most of current AAA titles.",normal,ps4,2015-06-12,English,1,0,8,test

The single-player campaign is filled with lore and additional stories that can be read and learned alongside environment art. Combined with trophies and collectables, the game has a very, very long lifecycle. In addition, two years after the game's release Naughty Dog still makes improvements and tweaks to the gameplay to balance and refine it. The DLC has helped make sure the multiplayer servers will stay up for a long time with streams of revenue.,,My only gripe is that there isn't more to play and Left Behind is a little too short -- beatable in one day.

L_Coops,"I'll preface this by saying I am not reviewing the remastered changes but the game as a whole.,,The Last of Us is quite simply the best game I have ever played and I've been an avid gamer since I was a kid in the 90's. I'll break up my review into three parts - game play, story and graphics.,,Game play - combat is TENSE. Running through guns blazing can result in a swift death and not to mention a loss of valuable ammunition and supplies. The Last of Us is all about survival; resources are scarce and every time you fire off a bullet you are making yourself that little bit more vulnerable in the long run. Sneaking is the preferred tactic of choice but ND do enough to keep the pace of encounters varied and exciting, often requiring to switch between stealth and aggression at the right moments. There is also a crafting system allowing Joel to keep stock of useful items like Molotov cocktails, smoke grenades and med kits. You are also able to upgrade your weapons as the game progresses, however as always supplies are limited and you won't be able to max everything out on your first play through.,,Story - this is where The Last of Us truly shines. The story, script and characters are masterfully woven into an experience that will resonate with you long after the credits stop rolling. There is real tragedy in this dark post-apocalyptic world and that pain is clearly reflected in Joel's character, set 20 years after the games initial prologue. Perhaps the most touching aspect to the story is the bond developed between Ellie and Joel and the way in which his character slowly comes to life as each chapter progresses. Ultimately this is a story of hope and second chances despite the world being in stark contrast.,,Graphics - stunning, beautiful and full of detail. The remastered version definitely delivers in this aspect. There's not much needed to be said here - just look at the videos and screenshots and you'll know it looks gorgeous.,,Overall this is a 10/10 masterpiece of a game and if you haven't yet played it I would seriously question your life choices.",normal,ps4,2015-05-17,English,1,0,10,train

But after the first  short intro segment i was hooked. From then i played the entire campaign over two days, the story is just so gripping i couldn't put the controller down.,,Its based in a post apocalyptic world in which a fungus called Cordyceps has infected humans leading to a a zombie outbreak, i really like the original spin on the zombie outbreak its different and refreshing. the main plot involves the transport of a young girl called Ellie to a research lab as she has an immunity to the fungus. Ellie is accompanied by Joel who is the main playable character.

OblivWrathy,"The Last of Us, without a doubt, tops my list for the best game I've ever played. The game on PS3, alone, was the best, but adding it to the next-generation console made the game even better, although it seemed impossible.,,The plot itself is enough to make the game fantastic. Adding Bruce Straley's great gameplay-directing, together with Neil Druckmann's amazing story-directing, makes the game perfectly balanced between gameplay and story. This unbelievable game, even though it's known, still hasn't reached out to that many  people, which is sad, because they're missing out on something that is truly life changing for hundreds of thousands people, including myself.,,""From Dreams: The Making of The Last of Us"" shows the work and dedication made to make this game possible is incredible. It only goes to show how they persevered even though they faced difficulty. It also shows the actors doing their absolute best performance to make the game as good as possible, cut-scene -wise. Troy Baker (AKA Joel,) made his best performance in this given scene: When the apocalypse has just happened, he meets up with his brother Tommy, and they escape from the horde of infected. They find this military soldier who, even though he doesn't want to, shoots his daughter Sarah. The way Joel reacts is so scarily realistic, it made me cry, which is a hard thing when it comes to video games.,,As for Ashley Johnson (AKA Ellie,) made her best performance when she is in the ranch, right after she goes away from Joel, and says ""Is that all they really had to worry about? Boys, movies, deciding which shirt goes with which skirt? It's bizarre."" Followed by another great performance by Troy, makes the scene very emotional indeed.,,Long sentence said short, The Last of Us is a life-changing, perfect game for me. The A.I is just about perfect for the game's purpose, and has taken gaming into the next level with it's no game in the future can even compare with The Last of Us.

UserScore,"I am not rating the game, but the port. The review for the game can be found in the profile.,The Last of Us: Remastered is a very good port. Although the 1080p isn't a huge change (even if it can be more of an improvement when you are looking at things in the distance), 60 fps are much appreciated. The game feels a lot smoother, it helps for making fast moves and it helps the overall expeience of multiplayer.,Photo Mode is a cool addition, though in terms of frames and filters it's a bit scarce. It's not like you will be using it a lot in your first playthrough, but I'm sure fans will have a good time trying to capture the game's beauty.,In terms of content, TLOU Remastered packs everything except the additional weapons and hats, which is a frustration for anyone who bought any of them and now moved on to the PS4 version. Considering it contains the excellent ""Left Behind"" DLC, and some cool maps, TLOU Remastered (I think) completely justifies it's price tag.,There's also the Grounded doccumentary and commentary form Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson for all the cinematics (though that doesn't include Left Behind, for some odd reason).,All in all TLOU Remastered is the definitive version of The Last of Us, though I wouldn't recommend it to players who have already experience the PS3 version.

JMARSseph,"The greatest game ever made......period. No other game before it has told a better, more human story than The Last of Us. The characters are strong, from the leads in Joel and Ellie, to each and every other character they are all given a defined life of their own. They all represent a side of humanity and the game does a fantastic job of creating each one as an individual, a unique individual. In hearing Hollywood is producing a movie, I cringed. They could not do justice to this story. At least not in a 1 to 3 hour movie. Perhaps a miniseries, 10 part, 10 hours. Anyway back to the game. The mechanics work just fine, the gameplay is great, the shooting, running, melee, all are top notch. The story grabs you from the start and does not let you go. I am a huge fan of Mass Effect and the development of each character within its story. The Last of Us creates a bond between player and characters like no other game. The entire game focuses on struggle, loss and the human desire to fight on and find any hope you can to drive you. I thought this would be another zombie game...I could not have been more wrong. Sure zombies infest the world, but the real terror is the people. Last of Us captures humanity in all its ugliness, and does it beautifully. I am 42 years old and have played games forever.

bristolian5,"Civilization is a fragile thing; this is highlighted in The Last Of Us. This game follows a basic zombie apocalypse story, but it communicates it in such a way as to make it feel real. The story grasps the player during the whole game. The game portrays zombies as a way that is rarely seen. Instead of zombies coming from a nuclear experiment gone wrong, or from nuclear radiation, they are created from spores; they are not even called zombies as they are so different, they are referred to as infected. The gameplay was fun and entertaining, I wanted to keep playing to know what would happened next. There were hardly any glitches, the only ones that I could find were graphical glitches that would not interfere with gameplay, but I had to go under rocks to perform. There was also one invisible wall off the beaten path. This game also comes with all the DLC included. The left behind DLC helped explain what Ellie did before the story of the main game. The online was mostly fun, but the main reason you should buy this game is for the single player. Unless you got The Last Of Us on the PS3, I highly recommend this game.

Thegodfatherson,"At one point in the brutal epic, The Last Of Us, Joel and Ellie share almost a father to daughter moment, and I felt like Naughty Dog doesn't need the success of Uncharted 4, because TLOU is a bracing masterpiece with a human nature and an unforgettable story that rewinds in my mind nights after finishing it. The aftermath of a virus, leave the world to senseless anarchy and corruption, and a group called the Fireflies fights it, there is no fair government. There are creepy clickers and runners lurking around the whole place which looks damn great on new hardware. Joel and Marlene are hired to protect Ellie, a girl with a special gift, she is immune to the virus. The amount of gritty tension during the stealth sequences of TLOU is harrowing and will leave you nights, sleepless. With great voice acting from Troy Baker as the rough Joel, may be his best yet. Naughty Dog is one developer that keeps surprising us each time, Uncharted already has acclaim, but if you play TLOU, you will be amazed. BTW, If you don't have it already, you are living under a rock, my friend. I replayed this epic three times and can't wait to do it again. The Left Behind DLC is included in this great package, and boy, for a DLC, it's brilliant. Left Behind tells Ellie's story behind the events of The Last Of Us. The Last Of Us is something Stanley Kubrick would have been proud of. It has incredible depth, great characters, jaw dropping visuals, and a hint of human that is not found in other games.

Kondorp96,"This is a game that i would recommend to any gamer who values story, and great stealth game play with a solid combat system, it is a must play game! the story between the main protagonist and the second protagonist is very in depth and makes you care about them. as you play through the story, their relationship continues to grow and you see this through many trials they are forced to go through together, in which brings them closer together. The story is that you're 20 years into an infection that gives humans a form of rabies via a mind controlling fungus (Which is real in our world, Scary!) and you must transport a girl that may be born with a cure, i won't go any further for spoiler reasons, but this is the basis of the story, you travel cross country fighting everything from infected to other survivors who are trying to kill everyone and salvage everything they can, Naughty Dog has knocked it out of the park with this game, the graphics are amazing and will stand it's ground in the gaming community for some time to come, the emotion that comes out in this game could bring you to tears at certain moments (It did for me) and you will find yourself actually caring about what happens in this game. the people you come across are varied enough to seem real, they each have their own personalities and opinions, this is such an alive game, I've beaten it and it still to this day blows me away. It adds more replay value with the Left Behind DLC and Factions Multiplayer that forces you to choose a faction and fight on that faction through different game modes, it also features a mini meta game that you help your clan grow by doing good in games.",normal,ps4,2015-04-05,English,2,2,10,train

UnKn0wN_DiSeAsE,"This is one of the most immersing game experiences I've ever had. I actually felt as if I had become Joel, trekking through this deadly, near hopeless world, struggling to survive for just one more day. On occasion, this level of immersion is broken, but for the most part, I truly felt like I had stepped into the shoes of the protagonist. His emotions became mine- the frustration, the elation, the horror, the desperation... and the slow, creeping pall of hopelessness in this dark, damaged earth.,,If you are prone to night terrors or depression, do NOT play this game, because it will alternately terrify you and make you despair for the plight of this lost world. However, if you can handle the mature subjects of the tale, you are in for a real treat, and perhaps the greatest game to ever be produced in the genre of survival horror.,,Yes, this game is scary, to a level I haven’t felt since the original Silent Hill on PS1. I generally felt powerless in this world and some of the enemies (primarily Clickers and Runners) make my stomach tighten with dread. If you're super hardcore, and you want a REALLY scary experience, I recommend you play on Hard difficulty for your first play-through, because the number of supplies (ammo, med kits, shivs, bombs, etc.) that are available on the Normal difficulty level are far too abundant for players who want a supreme challenge.,,On the subject of crafting, this is a component of the game that is easy to learn, and fun to engage in. It further puts you into the mindset of Joel, a man desperate for survival, who has learned to salvage at all available opportunities. Slowly tuning up my weapons was also a lot of fun, though Joel is but a pale imitator compared to his rival protagonists (Nathan Drake, Marcus Fenix, etc.) in other games (but this is a good thing, for it feels realistic, and fits with the tone of the piece). Joel's wobbly aim, perpetual shortage of ammo, and rather sluggish speed make him feel like a real, middle-aged guy who has learned to survive in a dangerous world, not some superhuman who handles everything with grace.,,The stealth aspect is also handled brilliantly, and engaging in it is extremely satisfying. This stealth system is a perfect evolution of that which was established in the Metal Gear Solid series (particularly #2), utilizing a great visual cone and audio circumference for your enemies, which must be studied for vulnerabilities and exploited at every possible opportunity. Determining how to approach each new challenge (lots of trial and error will be involved), and how to successfully clear an area of enemies (generally without being detected, as ammo and health are so limited) is really fun. These challenges become ""3D puzzles"" in a way, as you must use your noggin to break down enemy patterns and AI reactions, with the added tension of knowing that it only takes one slip-up to result in failure - and these enemies really do make you feel the fear.,,Visually speaking, this game is remarkable, even by next gen standards. The improved graphics of the Remastered edition are immediately apparent to those who of us who played The Last of Us on PS3. Resolutions are incredibly detailed, but even more effective is the silky smooth frame rate. The attention to detail is simply staggering, and it all comes together to further enhance the emotional impact of this unforgettable experience. Gameplay is always more important than graphics in my book, but it certainly helps convey the emotions of the characters when everything looks this darned good.,,The Last of Us is like nothing else. It is, quite frankly, an exhausting experience, one that left my mind reeling with the consequences of my fascinating journey, and the unbreakable bonds I had formed with Ellie and Joel - two fictitious characters who seem unshakably real. I just can’t forget about them, and I can’t forget about what we’ve been through together. It’s not just their story, it’s OUR story. We are family, struggling to survive in a dangerous world.

The graphics are compelling, the environment is immersive, walking through a deserted suburb neighborhood, looking at all the abandoned houses, piles of burnt bodies, and flooded cities, and how Joel and Tess are so numb from the apocalypse that killing someone is just an everyday thing, makes you think what people are capable of when the situation is so grave. The story is unlike anything I've experienced in a video game, the ending really leaves you in the dark in some ways, and that's okay. It almost leaves you to decide what goes through Ellie's mind when she said that final ""okay"" and then the game cuts to black. It has one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've played, the 4v4 matches, while it may sound very boring, Naughty Dog really did a great job with it. It feels like real combat, you're always behind cover, planning your course of action, hoping an enemy isn't around the corner when you have no ammo while they're fully loaded ready to go. Every time I die, it feels like I really die, and that I didn't help out my team enough, and I've never felt this playing a game. It really requires you to communicate with your teammates, plan out tactics, call out enemies, or just go lone wolf and hope for the best. The maps for the most part, are well designed, it could use more game modes, leveling up can be quite difficult at times, but overall, its really an above average experience in my opinion.

Firedthaboss,"I don't get all the praise of this game. I came here expecting something as great as GTA V but what I got was only great. GAMEPLAY: This is where The Last of Us falls flat. The game has semi linear levels but gives you room to explore and you might find supplies and craft Molotovs, Medkits, and the like. However there are only 6 components. You can only carry a set amount of components however you can't have for example 3 rags but 1 sugar but can carry 2 rags but 2 sugar. So there's no dynamic inventory system. The gameplay starts to become a drag near the end.,STORY: This game shines as with it's story. While it's predictable the characters are likable but Joel AKA you makes a scripted selfish choice that makes him come off as a giant **** a choice that could make the human race be completely wiped out and breaking a friend's dying wish. Ellie is extremely likable and actually makes me wish she deserved better someone then Joel. I don't want be a perfect character, however I don't want to be a selfish douche who makes a selfish choice that could endanger all of humanity. OVERALL: This game should be a movie, not a game.

I have to say this is one of the best games I have ever (and probably will ever) played, and is beautifully crafted in almost every way. The graphics are stunning, for me the controls were mostly spot on but on some weapons trying to aim accurately was a bit of a struggle. Some are criticizing the story and character development but I thought the story was well thought out and gave rise to different opportunities and styles of gameplay that you had to adapt to, so I certainly don't think it was repetitive, and plenty of hours worth of gameplay to get stuck into. You could see character development but I do think that at times the character interaction was very limited and it was a bit frustrating that a lot of the times they interacted were during cut scenes. The voice overs were however, excellent and the game/characters draws you in, and the music is perfectly matched to the game.

CaT-LiN_,"The Last of Us: Remastered has top-notch presentation and voice-acting. The icreased framerate from 30 to 60 fps in this Remaster really helps the game out and the combat flows more organically compared to the PS3 version.,The gameplay consists of stealth, combat, crafting and exploring.,When exploring there is a chance for short conversations between characters to take place which are interesting and at times humerous. Stealth, combat and crafting unfortunately don't offer depth.,What follows from that is -I hate to say it- generic and shallow gameplay with no big variation betweeen segments. As good as the presentation, characters and their relationships are, we are talking about a video game that is lacking in the game aspect. On top of that it's hit or miss with the story itself. At times the game suddenly skips to the next season of the year, which can feel totally out of place and random.,,Usually I don't give a lacking game anything above a 6 but the qualities TLOU:R has bump it up to a 7.,Let's remember: just because it's SCEA top studio Naughty Dog doesn't mean everything is shiny and flawless,",normal,ps4,2015-02-22,English,0,0,7,train

The game is a lot smoother and runs at an unlocked 60fps, this means that it can and will drop below that, but for the most part it remains smooth and the higher res textures are much more pleasing to the eye.

njlake,"The one thing I've come to absolutely hate in games is a terrible hit/aiming system. A game developer that is really good at creating terrible hit/aiming systems is Naughty Dog.,,I've played video games all my life. Love playing all different styles, but I can't stand when a game has poor mechanics. Most games do get repetitive and I understand that but Naughty Dog seriously has reskinned the Uncharted series and added in a slightly different story. Yes, the story is good, but what I kept asking myself is ""who in their right mind thought this was actually fun or good in any way!?"",,So my major complaints are:,1. Aim/hit system is seriously flawed and so frustrating. Not only do you have to go for head shots every time but if you don't hit certain enemies you're going to die. And the worst part is that ammo is so scarce you can't even take extra shots. It's extremely frustrating when you can't defend yourself because you didn't get the perfect shot off on an enemy.,,2. Mechanics. Ellie is constantly getting in your way and seems to do it conveniently when you're trying to run or do something quick. Go to turn around and your almost guaranteed to be pinned into a room because she literally is a shadow to you. Plus the climbing, moving planks/ladders/dumpsters is so cumbersome.,,3. Clickers are the worst. Generally in most games, characters gain abilities to better defend or attack enemies. Not in this game! Throughout, clickers can only be killed by head shots (oh they take 2 head shots by the way, which is awesome seeing as ammo is really hard to come by; see point 1) or by shiv. And, you have to make shivs.... Terrible. You would think that maybe, somewhere along the lines you would come across a knife that you always carry. Nope! Instead you have to find supplies over and over only to have them quickly depleted. Dumb...,,Played the Uncharted series and had similar thoughts. Having to empty whole clips into enemies to take them out with limited ammo is so frustrating unless you happen to get that perfect shot off. This is a WILDLY overrated peice of garbage. Naughty Dog, seriously, do something new. You clearly know how to craft great stories, but your gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. This game is unoriginal and repetitive throughout. Seriously, rent or borrow it before you buy.",normal,ps4,2015-02-02,English,32,5,3,train

Darkly_Tranquil,"Beautiful, brutal, shocking, and heartbreaking. These a just a few words I could use to describe what I regard as possible the best game I have played in more than 25 years of gaming. The Last of Us ticks all the boxes for a classic:,,[*] Graphics - All the characters are fully motion captured and move with a degree of fluidity and realism that I have rarely seen matched in other games. Aside from a few long distance textures, the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, pulling you into the post-collapse world that the characters find themselves trying to navigate through.,,[*] Story - TLoU has one of the best written stories of a game I played, crafting characters who feel incredibly real and placing them within a decaying world setting that is both awful and plausible. While the core plot of the game has undoubtedly been done before, it has rarely, if even been executed with the nuance, pacing, style, and care as it has been here. If you care about story and character development in your games, TLoU hits it out of the park.,,[*] Music - The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack to the game, written by Oscar winning composer Gustavo Santolalla, perfect fits with the melancholy tone of the game as the characters struggle through the a world in which the remnants of human civilisation are slowly being reclaimed by the natural world. It is easily up there with the best videogame soundtracks ever written.,,[*] Voice Acting - Brilliant across the board, the voice cast of TLoU convey the grief, fear, despair, and hatred of the characters they inhabit, elevating their characters to a level of believability rarely achieved in the medium. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, as the voices of the two main characters, Joel and Ellie, carry the game of the strength of their exceptional performances and are, to my mind at least, the benchmark against which all other videogame voice acting will be measured.,,[*] Gameplay - If The Last of Us can be said to have any weakness, its that its gameplay is not as exceptional as every other facet of the game. The combat borrows heavily from Naughty Dog's other franchise ""Uncharted"", using third person melee and shooting combat, combined with a fairly simple stealth and crafting systems. While the combat is enjoyable, it remains fairly basic and does not have anything like the depth of the stealth action of something like Metal gear Solid. That said, it works well enough and keeps you sufficiently engaged to push the story along. The crafting mechanics are again, basic, but all the things you can make are useful and encourage you to think about what you will build and how you will use the finite resources you have at your disposal. But for all its limitations, the gameplay is never bad and doesn't detract from the overall experience, its simply not as outstanding as the rest of the package.,,Its rare that you can look at a game and say, ""This is a work of art"", but the The Last of Us is without a doubt one of those rare, exceptional games that transcends the limitations of its medium and achieves that lofty status. If you are a gamer who cares about storytelling in your games, TLoU is an unmissable experience in cinematic videogame storytelling and shows just what medium can do in the hands of truly skilled creators given the room by publishers to pursue their vision to its fullest potential.",normal,ps4,2015-01-26,English,0,0,10,train

DemonicSoul,"Story: Twenty years after a pandemic radically transformed known civilization, infected humans run amuck and survivors kill one another for sustenance and weapons. Joel, a salty survivor, is hired to smuggle a fourteen-year-old girl, Ellie, out of a rough military quarantine, but what begins as a simple job quickly turns into a brutal journey across the country. Despite how familiar the story is, what makes this story worth playing through is how exceptionally well the story is told. The writing is superb, the performances are spot on, the dialogue is believable, and all the characters, especially Joel and Ellie, are interesting and worth following along on this adventure. Even though Joel is the main character, Ellie steals the spotlight from him due to how she was written as a girl forced to grow up in this type of environment. She feels like an actual person; everything from her talks with Joel and other characters, to her movement, and Ashley Johnson's incredible performance. This game is a prime example of how storytelling > story originality. You even get the ""Left Behind"" DLC about Ellie's past for extra value! 10/10,,Gameplay: TLOU might be made from the same guys that made Uncharted, but it's nothing like that. You're not gonna be mowing down dozens of enemies and jumping from roof-to-roof. This is a game all about survival. Your health can't regenerate, you need to scavenge items in order to craft various tools that can help you, stealth is important if you're hoping to avoid wasting resources, ammo is scarce, you need to craft upgrades for your weapons, and find supplements in order to upgrade yourself. There are also infected in this game which are different from your average zombie due to how their infection is based on a actual Cordyceps fungi. This adds a new refreshing take on the ""zombie apocalypse"" cliche since it explores the question of what would happen if this type of fungi can infect humans instead of just insects. The infected themselves, while only featuring 4 different types, are able to add a new level of intensity to this game-turning several sections of the game into something out of a survival-horror game due to creepy nature of these critters and how they act (the ""clickers"" are a definite highlight of this). People might complain that the A.I. is dumb for ignoring Ellie, but I heavily disagree with this since this saves the game from turning into a tedious escort-mission like Resident Evil 4 (even if this could break the immersion of the game at times). The A.I. themselves are strong otherwise, there are collectibles here, the shooting and cover is strong, the stealth is really good, and the game now runs at 60fps thanks to the PS4's hardware. The gameplay is overall near-perfection in my eyes. 10/10,,Graphics: Thanks to the PS4, we have an already amazing looking PS3 game turn into an outstanding looking PS4 game, and one of the few ""next-gen"" looking games out right now. The motion-capture is incredible, the environments look detailed and overrun with foliage due to civilization being gone for 2 decades, the infected look extremely believable and probably what Cordycep-infected humans might look like if such a fungi were to exist, and the environments, textures, and shadows all look even better. Thanks to the PS4, the game runs at 1080p resolution. Naughty Dog essentially took what was already great with the visuals and made them even better. 10/10,,Sound: The game has a perfect sense of timing-the game knows when to let it's great score play out, and when to let natural sounds take over the background. The guns also sound impactful, the melee sounds are brutal, and the infected sound extremely creepy (especially the clickers and bloaters). Naughty Dog also knocked it out-of-the-park when it comes to the sound design. 10/10,,Multiplayer: Unfortunately, this is where the game stumbles for me. In the multiplayer, titled ""Factions"", you either join the ""Fireflies"" or the ""Hunters"" (both are the same) and are tasked with surviving for 12 weeks and 7 days until help arrives for you. Here's the problem with the ranking system: 1 match=1 day. So you have to play 90 MATCHES in order to complete your story, skill isn't a factor. This is a grind-y MP mode and it shows. Other problems include: a metagame where you have to feed your survivors with food you gather during matches (forces you to do well in EVERY match you're in), gunplay can be a bit repetitive, buying armor feels out-of-place in a SURVIVAL MP mode, lack of customization, limited to only 3 modes, some maps are designed in an annoying 3-lane design, supply boxes can barely help you at times, micro-DLC, and matchmaking issues. If you have 3 other friends though, this can be fun as it requires more teamwork than even Battlefield. As for me, it just came off as decent. At least you get all the DLC packs though. 6/10,,Verdict: TLOU is to me, one of the best games ever made; and definitely worth a (2nd) purchase.,,Rating: 10/10",normal,ps4,2015-01-01,English,0,0,10,train

I found myself staring at the horizon and trying to drink up every detail right from the start. Beautiful.,,- The storyline. The writing & dialogue is nothing short of genius and will quickly wrangle your interest. I felt thoroughly invested in the characters and the plot-line.,,- Mini-convos with Ellie/whomever is following you at the time feel real and immersive.,,- Even when fighting/sneaking Ellie will comment (whisper if you're sneaking) on the enemies or area or whatnot (it's specific too depending on who/what is after you.) It's difficult to explain why this is such a positive other than the fact it gives the game a realistic feel. Small details like this made a good game great.,,Cons,,- Listening mode no longer exists (which is fine it was rather OP & broke immersion a bit as I felt like it was a sci-fi ability) yet the tutorial still includes it. Also, increasingly listening mode's range is still an available upgrade for Joel despite the fact it has been removed. You have a limited number of pills (upgrade currency) & upgrades cannot be undone. However, Naughty Dog is usually excellent at patching things like this and I'd be surprised if this wasn't fixed soon. Still, beware.,,- The highest difficulty settings can be a bit frustrating. Not necessarily due to legit difficulty, but random things like being one shot less than a second after a cutscene can be frustrating. That said, only crazy masochists like my fiance play on those settings. :) For most, this won't be an issue.,,All in all, this is a game I would recommend for just about anyone looking to christen their PS4 or as a Christmas gift as all aspects of this game had excellent development.

Since playing this masterpiece, nothing has come close to meeting the high expectations for narrative scope and world design that the developers Naughty Dog have set.,I'll begin with the one negative I can genuinely think of for this game: The weapon choice for the flamethrower seems a bit out of place and its inclusion towards the end doesn't really make sense. That's it. Pretty minor, and when the only criticism you have for a game is that there's a **** flamethrower in it, you know you're playing something pretty good.,Onto the positives:,1. The story, whilst it's been done a thousand times before, feels fresh, and you genuinely don't know where it's going at all. It's pacing is perfect, with massive, adrenaline fuelled bosses/set pieces juxtaposed with moments of tranquillity, just to explore the world. The way it's told doesn't miss a beat through it's 13-16 hour run time. An emotionally gripping tale topped with a somewhat bittersweet finale.,2.The world that's been crafted is one of the finest in all of gaming, as it portrays a barren society through its dilapidated buildings and overgrown vegetation whilst keeping the sense that this world was once inhabited. The areas you traverse are varied and interesting, encouraging exploration into every nook to discover another artifact that pieces the story together.,3. The characters are all very engaging, however the two that the story focuses on, two survivors brought together by circumstance, have an unmatched level of depth and chemistry. Their relationship grows and dwindles and breaks and reforms multiple times throughout the story, with the excellent voice acting and motion capture for these two making their trials and tribulations feel authentic. You want to root for these two, but at times you'll question whether you should.,4. The gameplay plays second fiddle to the story, however the immersion of the combat drags you deeper into the world by making you carefully craft items and hoard ammo from a limited amount of supplies found throughout the world. This makes you scavenge for more ways to survive, and also shapes the way you enter fights, with the constant danger of being without ammo always just one mistimed shot away. The human enemies encountered are standard, but the two main zombies (Infected as they're referred to) fought add terror and variety to proceedings. They make you use stealth, craft bombs and keep your distance because confronting them is so distressing. Action sequences are pulsating and nerve wracking at once, the way they should be.,5. The musical score is immense, nothing more to add.,6. The DLC is pretty awesome and adds an overall insight into one of gaming's best child characters, Ellie, as we see her touching yet inevitably tragic back story unfold.,7. The online multiplayer is more enjoyable than expected. Whilst I wouldn't buy the game solely for it, it offered a few more fun hours with the combat mechanics.,,To conclude, The Last of Us is the best game I have ever played. It's gripping, heartbreaking, eye opening and stunning all at the same time. A masterpiece, a game that hopefully proves what impact video games can have on the entertainment medium.

Ninjo,"The Last Of Us:Remastered was a game picked up recently with my Ps4 as part of a bundle. I did previously it on the Ps3 and thoroughly enjoy it's Campaign and characters.,,Not much has a changed from the either version accept from a graphical point of view and play style, the new features which were included would defiantly be the way the controller affects the immersion and realistic nature of the game; such as the controller's back lights to indicate your health status, torchlight and batteries placement sound effects which occur obviously when you're out of battery life haha.,,The overall game felt in my opinion a lot slower, such as the way people moved which in turn changed the battle system to a more realistic war zone. This was found evident in my first multiplayer game in ""Factions"" as I loved the online on TLOU and I feel it was so underrated and overshadowed by the amazing story! But yeah I remember my first words when I got in to the game was ""F***ing this has changed"" expecting the game play to relatively similar because Ps3 version was excellent in itself.,,Final review would be that this game is excellent, I rated only a 9 due to not really having any replay ability as I felt the good thing from your first playthrough is you didn't what to expect and that created such a good atmosphere while playing.,,Is the game much different from its predecessor? Not really, not much noticeable changes apart from minor things I've noticed. This game is a must purchase but not if you've played it before and are looking to play the campaign again, but if your looking to play online defiantly worth it for that because its so unique and nothing like any other multiplayer experience you would've ever had before.,,Thanks for reading my review of The Last of Us:Remastered Ps4,,Ninjo",normal,ps4,2014-11-21,English,1,0,9,train

jacobstone4,"Okay first off let me clarify that my actual score is more like an 8.7 rather than a nine. The Last of Remastered bring everything the original had back with that little graphical kick for the PS4 has to offer. (I.E. the giraffe scene) It's a fantastic video game with a beautiful well written story and ultimately fantastic conclusion that is something only Naughty Dog themselves can pull off. Now some of you may wonder why I praise it so much but only give it an 8.5. Well I will tell you right now in three simple words....immersion breaking A.I. It happens quite often to me at least. I am getting immersed so deep playing on grounded mode, hiding from clickers or hunters and then boom Ellie dips out of cover clearly in front of them and for a split second I am screaming at her but then I remember that they can't ""see"" Ellie. It totally broke my immersion even if its only for a minute its still something that deeply bothers when playing such a tense game. Now the sections where you play by yourself (without an A.I. companion) are by far some of the most tense sections I have ever encountered in a video game period. Well that is the single player because I don't want to spoil anything for those select few who still haven't played it yet for some odd reason. Now the multiplayer which also docks some critical points off this review. The multiplayer is very straight simple but in the best way possible. It is fun and can keep you attached for hours on end....at least until your ""group"" gets wiped out because of the stupid metagame Naughty Dog decided to put in for some odd reason. I mean come on multiplayer is about having fun but with this metagame its almost like you have this little thing in the back of your head saying ""Be the best"" which for me at least takes away part of the fun because I feel pushed to ""try hard"" every game and be number on the boards when i should just be having fun. But survivors is one of the tense multiplayer games I have played yet, far more tense than Search and Destroy on Call of Duty. Anyway these two negatives aside the positives far outweigh the negatives in this game and I would highly recommend to anyone who has the slightest thought of picking it up. I restate my score of an 8.5 and will add its one of the best looking Playstation 4 games for the console right now.",normal,ps4,2014-11-18,English,1,0,9,test
mrwarcriminal,"WOW! If there was ever a ""Must Buy"" game this is the one. Its not hype when i say i couldnt put the game down. Over the past 10 years not many games are worth $60 especially if the game is story heavy. And the main focus is a multiplayer that indefinitely extends play-time. I never thought a story focused game would be worth the full price but again this game is. The story sucks you in and makes you care about the characters. I was so involved that i was having to step back and take in just how much i was emotionally involved. Im cynical as hell and never believed this game could even be close to as good as advertised. I didnt buy on PS3; playing something else. And thank god...the remastered version comes with all DLCs so my first experience was even better. I probably wouldnt have bought this game either if i wasnt looking for a PS4 game but im so glad i did. Also the multiplayer isnt just tacked on. Multiplayer play is really unique and lot of fun to play. I couldnt believe how many peeps who played this on the PS3 couldnt wait to pay $60 again to play on PS4. Final words...Do not buy another game until you play this. You will love it. Believe the hype and get this game. Its the best game for the PS4 easy.

From the great visuals, to the great, lively characters, to the unforgiving but greatly rewarding gameplay, which makes you feel human: with no superpowers, resources are scarce, and you always have to think of a strategy in order to survive.

The colours pops out beautifully and the visuals are fan-f**kingtastic    . I have never seen a game this graphically awesome. The only thing I don't like about the game is the AI system. The AI is extremely clunky at times, sometimes they don't know where you are at, stuck near a wall and stuff like that. The enemy AI is quite dumb, even on HARD mode. They also have the same problem with the allies, too, some of which that could spoil the whole game. Stealth still okay at least. Without the AI problems, it would have been a perfect game, but still, if you want to get red eyes (good thing) when you see the graphics, i have to recommend this game for you, even when you have played the original.

v0nd3,"Played On: Hard,,While The Last of Us delivers a superb story, it's held back by some questionable gameplay mechanics that seem to keep it from being an entirely satisfying experience. More often than not, the game forces players into combat situations that feel arbitrarily set in place. While sneaking past enemies is certainly a mainstay in the game, at times it will throw unexpected enemies at the player that cannot be avoided, forcing a fight.,,While this wouldn't be such an issue in certain other games, it does take one out of the seriousness of the story itself when you are forced to have Joel run up and brawl several enemies to death. This, mixed with the lack of ammo one will find later on (despite the fact you can stealth kill individuals who are equipped with fully loaded guns and they drop nothing) ends up making the game feel like a brawl-a-thon which is clunky and boring.,,Mechanics aside, the story is what really shines through. While the overall story arc itself isn't particularly unique or interesting, what makes the game are the characters. Ellie is perhaps one of the best female leads in a video game in history, while Joel, often called ""Tex"" by his partner earlier in the story, really sells the hard-ass survivor, and his character arc is one of the best I've seen in recent media story-telling. However, a chapter near the middle that starts off interesting begins to feel as if it demands too much time for too little pay-off, with its finish eliciting a sigh of relief rather than a fond farewell.,,Overall, while the story itself is quite enjoyable, primarily the characters themselves, it begins to drag in one of the middle chapters before picking up once again in the next, and the gameplay mechanics begin to feel like a detriment rather than a benefit half-way to three-quarters of the way through it.

Fortunately, I had my chance with the Remastered version on the PS4, and I absolutely loved it. Through and through, Naughty Dog creates a masterful story with very solid gameplay that keeps you on your toes and makes you think before you act. This is especially important in the multiplayer, which offers a very nice change of pace compared to the traditional CoD shooter title. Exclusive to the Remastered version is the ability to run the game at 60fps. It might seem like a picky detail, but swapping between the locked 30fps and then changing it back to 60, I couldn't imagine playing the game any other way.

Kenophobia,"The Last of Us: Remastered returns with one Naughty Dog’s most critically acclaimed titles in beautiful 1080p with included DLC.  But, does The Last of Us: Remastered warrant purchase on Sony’s next-generation, or was it best left untouched and in the past?,,While I never experienced The Last of Us on PS3, I was able to spend about 100+ playing The Last of Us: Remastered on PS4 in both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes.  The Last of Us: Remastered is one of the most brilliant singleplayer stories ever created, and despite being set in an already overpopulated post-apocalyptic survival genre, does an excellent job of distinguishing itself as a truly remarkable title. The singleplayer story will have you on the edge of your seat throughout its entirety as Naughty Dog puts you through an emotional rollercoaster of events set in the not so distant future. Threats lie around every corner, and you will be challenged on even the easiest of difficulty settings.  However, while The Last of Us: Remastered delivers an exceptional experience in terms of its singleplayer, the same cannot be said for the multiplayer.  While the multiplayer gametypes deliver a rather refreshing and unique variant on the third person shooter, they fail to provide what could have been a defining feature of the title. The multiplayer component of the game is plagued by network issues, incomplete balancing, and DLC pay-to-win microtransactions that prevent players from enjoying the multiplayer as it could have been.  However, the shortcomings of The Last of Us: Remastered multiplayer should not prevent anyone from purchasing it, as the game is truly a testament to what singleplayer should be in videogames. Naughty Dog truly delivered one of the most influential and memorable gaming experiences, and I hope that this IP becomes one of Naught Dog’s flagship franchises alongside the Uncharted series. If you have already played The Last of Us on PS3, you might want to pass on the Remastered version, but if you have never played the title, I highly recommend you make this part of your collection.",normal,ps4,2014-11-05,English,2,0,9,train

This version is a strong upgrade in performance from the original. It boasts an impressive 1080p and 60fps with increased draw distance. The assets themselves are somewhat enhanced too. Most of the DLC is included with this release as well. For those looking for cinematic, almost movie-like games, this is a must play. The gameplay is nice and having to manage your limited ammo and inventory is a nice survival horror staple which works well here. The impact of melee fighting in the game feels great as well. This game truly shines in its story, while it doesn't do anything new for storytelling (which is terribly difficult to accomplish in the over-saturated ""zombie"" genre), it does play cliches straight through impressive writing and dialogue.

MiseryPS4,"As for the game The Last Of Us, my impressions are very positive. To begin with, the game is not a typical representative of a post-apocalyptic shooter or action games, the game is a mix of dashed hopes of a man, as of one, and the whole of humanity, inner feelings of each character, in this case, the depth of suffering different people entirely depends on the nature of that excellent tracks in the game, and in the end, great gameplay, controls and setting. I lowered the game by one point estimate for a fairly controversial ending in terms of ""good"" humanity, if it can be called so, and some strange moments in the game that you can just ""run"". As for the version for next-generation consoles, it is awesome. Fps consistently high, graphics and textures are on a very good level. Overall: great remake of one of the best exclusives of the past generation, and certainly the game, which can not be passed by anyone, ever.

Начать нужно с того, что игра не является типичным представителем пост-апокалиптических шутеров или экшенов, игра являет собой микс из разбившихся надежд человека, как одного, так и всего человечества, внутренних переживаний каждого персонажа, при этом, глубина страдания разных людей целиком и полностью зависит от характера, что отлично прослеживает в игре, и, в конце концов, замечательного геймплея, управления и сеттинга. Снижу же я этой игре оценку на один балл за довольно спорную концовку с точки зрения ""пользы"" человечеству, если это можно так назвать и некоторых странных моментов в игре, которые можно просто ""пробежать"". Что касается версии для консоли нового поколения, то она потрясающая. Кадры в секунды стабильно высокие, графика и текстурки на очень хорошем уровне.

Lodge1960,"An astonishing game. One of the very few games actually made for adults. And I don't mean your average 14 year olds concept of adult, i.e. lots of nudity and violence. It certainly does contain plenty of the latter, but by adult I mean  a proper emotionally based story where the characters change and evolve as it unfolds. This dynamic shift in the protagonists relationship is subtly played out through their interactions. A testimony to the story telling is that at the start of the game Joel really hasn't much time for Ellie at all and at one point is in two minds whether to just abandon her. However, by the end he is willing to sacrifice a possible cure for mankind to save her life. Due to the craftsmanship of the subtle story telling the player completely and utterly understands and sympathises with his action. I also like the non-stereotypical portrayal of a gay man.

FrenchToast,"TLOU is an extremely pretty game. It does enough to separate itself from its PS3 counterpart to warrant a second purchase. This package includes the Left Behind expansion and all multiplayer DLC. The story is incredible. There are twist and turns and you never really know what will happen next. I found myself having no idea when the game would end!. The intro is extremely emotional. The game takes hold there and never lets go although the first 30-1:00 after that are extremely boring. Once you get through that it is a great game. The visuals are stunning. Combat requires carefully planned strategy and execution. The gunplay feels a bit clunky at first after upgrading Joel and acquiring more powerful weapons it feels right at home. The zombie AI is frustrating but not intelligent. It will get cheap shots on you more times than you can count and getting killed by a clicker (a powerful zombie that  can instakill you if it gets close) sometimes these aren't fair and restarting an area with them over and over again gets tiresome. The same can't be said for human enemies. They are extremely smart. They will find ways to get around you and attack you from behind. Fighting a group of enemies at once is extremely stressful and nerve wracking. The locations throughout the story are varied and beautiful. The last section of combat in the story is tiresome and a low point. Crafting requires thinking as things like health packs use the same equipment as molotovs.,The multiplayer is great and puts a new spin on stealth gameplay. It requires careful coordinating with other players. It has an extremely steep learning curve. My best advice is move slow and stick with your teammates. The crafting interface works well here and the maps fit in nicely. The left behind DLC is good but not as much as the main story line.

daringo5,"After seeing all the review sites and shows giving this game awards, I finally decided to pick it up on the ps4. What a big mistake and waste of money that was......  I was expecting some amazing storyline with amazing gameplay but that is not what this game is at all.,Gameplay is the most annoying thing I have ever felt when playing a game. The stealth aspect is so broken... you spend 90% of the time sneaking past enemies - then at the last moment get spotted by a clicker or infected, then get bitten on the neck because this game has no real weapons whatsoever, and have to end up doing it all over again. There seems to be millions of bricks laying around but no weapons at all.,There is no point even having a gun in this game as ammo is so scarce. Consider yourself lucky if you have 6 units of ammo in your inventory! Also another joke in this game is that in other games where we actually have something called a ""Knife""  in this game they expect us to keep making our own shivs, and the only way to take down some enemies is to sneak up and shiv them.. what a joke...... Surely we come across so many allies in the game and someone is bound to have a knife.,The storyline is cliche. Same old story of town getting infected by zombie virus and you fighting for survival. The only good thing is the voice acting in the game but thats about it.,The graphics are not ground breaking either... Im surprised seeing people go on about how amazing the graphics are, but they just look average in my opinion. People seem to be getting excited over its ability to render at 60fps at 1080p, but whats the point? seeing as the gameplay is lacking 100% in this. Also the game puts you in smaller environments where draw-distance is not required, so its bound to have a higher frame per second..,I would not recommend anyone to buy this game, especially at full price.

It is also hyped up to the max, best game ever it simply is not (for me anyway)(storyline yes).,,Lets start with the good, of which there is a lot. Gameplay is genuinely engrossing and challenging, I haven't played the game on the easier settings, starting off on the hardest, and some areas are really tough. You have to conserve and choose when to use ammo etc. The game is very atmospheric (graphically too), sometimes chilling.. It actually scared the **** out of me a couple of times!,,Combat and shooting is quite tough, upgrading is essential.. the AI of the enemies is ok, not brilliant, but they don't all just run and gun. Stealthing is really fun, taking out enemies slowly and tactically is much more rewarding than trying to gun everyone down, although how Ellie doesn't get you discovered!,,Onto the storyline, the famous storyline... Yea its amazing! I really did go though this game with a genuine connection to the characters, it's hard not to be empathetic.., i won't go into too much detail, i'm sure you already know. I replayed this game straight after i finished because I enjoyed it so much.,,So why not a ten? Simply because for me a game has to be perfect to get a ten.. i guess for me perfect means I play a game for months without getting bored,.. hence why games like Guitar Hero (yes!) and Halo are better, for me personally.. I suppose it depends on what your priorities are.. A perfect game fom me has to be at its core, addictive and fun to play for many, many weeks if not months. The Last Of Us is addictive for a little less time.

sems1193,"It’s an understatement to say that TLOU: Remastered is well made. It was an already magnificently produced game when it launched in June of 2013, and with this reiteration, pushed by the hardware of the Playstation 4, The Last of Us Remastered is a polished treat not to be missed by Sony newcomers and people in general who’ve not played the game and own a PS4. Being a Sony newcomer myself, this review will focus on all aspects of the game, not just the revamps.,,The setting is a post-apocalyptic world wherein the story of Joel is told, a story that covers the struggle of survival while also tackling themes of finding purpose in a world beaten by devastation. The world has been hit by a pandemic, Cordyceps, inspired by a real fungal parasite that affects several species of insects, only here it has evolved to affect humans and the effects are nothing short of lethal and terrifying. Eventually Joel and Ellie cross paths, and this will unfold a well written, beautifully performed journey that shines and stands tall in what one could consider an oversaturated ocean of post-apocalyptic tales. Naughty Dog succeeds in telling a story that, albeit unoriginal, is gripping and engrossing by developing likeable characters and an outstanding dialogue coupled with amazing voice performances. Caring about the lead characters is inevitable, and thanks to the perfect pacing of the story, one will continuously desire to see where and how their stories end.,,As a video game, TLOU provides plenty of engaging, fun action. The gameplay covers from traversing through a variety of beautifully made scenarios to shootings and crafting. This is not an FPS; the game encourages stealth, even more so in higher difficulties (which are recommendable for a higher feeling of entertainment). Ammo is scarce, melee weapons degrade with use, and enemy AI is smart by reacting to sounds—they will hold their attack if you take one hostage, and they will even attack you more ferociously if you try to fire your gun only to find out it’s empty. And those are only the human enemies. Cordyceps, though not organized, are varied and aggressive and will provide a huge challenge if unprepared. Crafting comes in handy and it cleverly encourages the player to explore the map in order to find tools to create better weapons, bombs, upgrades, and ammo. All these factors provide a tension that so rightly fits in a video game with this theme.,,Even better, the game comes packed with a multiplayer mode that works perfectly within the context of TLOU’s atmosphere. Having the player join one of two factions and using the same gameplay system of the single player experience, multiplayer becomes a strategic battle where teamwork is invaluable; going solo is not going to pay off. It also serves a purpose; matches come with challenges to achieve, furthering the journey of your faction towards salvation.,,All of this is enhanced by the power of the PS4 that makes the image look crisp and beautiful. The character and scenery models are nothing short of intricate. Better lighting and shadows, along with a more complex particle effect system give the game even better graphics. Not even the E3 demo of the original game looked this good.,,When all these aspects come together, the pinnacle of immersive experiences in video games is achieved. Owning a PS4 system is reason alone to assume TLOU Remastered is in one’s collection. It’s a game not to be missed. The Last of Us Remastered may be overhyped, but damn if it didn’t meet that hype and then some.",normal,ps4,2014-09-28,English,5,2,10,train

TheCartoon77,"The Last of Us Remastered is perhaps the most frustrating game I've seen this year not because of the combat or characters or story or anything in the game itself for that matter. Just how much attention and praise its gotten for being the same game but prettier and on a different system. TLOU is a good game, no doubt about it. The combat is flawless and executed perfectly in every way. Not to get ahead of myself here, but the combat is actually, in my opinion, is as sleek and satisfying as the Batman games. The characters are relatable and none of them are irritating or arbitrary in any way. The game has its eyes on cinematic side to games, just like Uncharted. It pulls it off nicely and thanks to the graphics makes cut scenes look like a Blu-Ray film, and the gameplay look like a work of interactive art. If there's one thing TLOU slips up on is the story progression. As in the places the characters go to seems a little too convenient or pre-determined a lot of the time. For example, in one section of the game you meet someone who just so happens to be a friend of the main character AND a mechanic to get them out of there as well as a car mechanic too.,,This game is recommended and does deserve the praise it gets despite the fact the people who get this for a second time on PS4 are unmistakably going to be playing the same game again.

Mistval,"This is the best single player game I've played since my Nintendo days, and I don't think I've ever felt so much for video game characters. The voice actors and writers did a terrific job, but what I think is even more impressive is the body language in the cutscenes. The artists did an unbelievably good job capturing all the nuances of human interaction.,,The gameplay itself always kept me on the edge of my seat, I always felt like I was in danger. Playing this game you quickly learn that something bad is always going to happen ""soon"", but you don't know what ""soon"" means. Some not-particularly scary places explode in your face while you're walking through, while sometimes dark buildings where you're sure a horde of zombies must be hiding, are actually empty. Caring about the characters amplifies this sense of danger. Even though dying has no major consequences, I still felt I desperately had to avoid it.,,To some extent, this is a stealth game. You will have a much easier time if you try to take out enemies quietly - or even sneak right past! For most part the stealth mechanics are pretty good. There was never a time when an enemy magically saw through a wall or something like that. On the other hand, the enemies can be amazingly oblivious to you sitting behind a crate with your head poking up above it. Or they will look right at you and shine a flashlight in your face, except you're like a hundred feet away and they can't see that far.,,Shooting mechanics are good and feel very realistic. Ammo is scarce so you find yourself taking careful aim and swearing when you miss.,,This game is very linear. Naughty Dogs is telling a story here, and it's NOT a story about the player, it's a story about Joel and Ellie. The two of them make monumental decisions with zero input from the player. You are guided by the environment from point A to point B along a pretty narrow path. It is common in such games that they are not very replayable. This is true here, too. While I did love playing through this game, I probably will not play the main story again, at least not for quite a while. The main story took me 12 hours to beat. After that you can try it on higher difficulties or look for collectible items and such if you're into that.,,Online multiplayer is actually pretty cool and I don't know of any other online games quite like it. It's pretty slow paced and tactical so you must be patient. There's a lot of hiding and creeping around and trying to get the angle on each other. Sadly, not that many people play it. The only gripe I have is that I wished they left out the ""listen"" ability that lets you see nearby, moving enemies through walls. It weakens the stealth aspect.,,They did an excellent job upgrading the graphics. I would not have guessed that it is a remastered PS3 game. It does seem like they missed a couple of spots, though. I remember being in a sewer and there were some chains attached to this grate so it could be lifted by pully. Except the chains weren't shaped like chains, they were clearly boxes with chain links painted on them.,,All in all if you don't have this game on your shelf, you're doing it wrong.

The storyline if modified is probably worth a movie at some point down the road, but as far as gameplay it gets repetitive and old very fast - you run around, collect items, shoot and kill zombies, infected, military, etc.. while going from point A to point B in a predefined path. There is no open world concept really, it is almost like you are playing a on-rails-shooter with some degree of flexibility how to kill your enemies. It gets boring, the level of complexity in ""puzzle solving"" is sad, and is better left to 1st graders (Don't, because it is not a game for kids...), lack of different paths in gameplay, or decision-consequence in the game is an eye-sore. Some tasks could be time-limited, outcomes of your ""faith"" or difficulty of the path chosen may depend on which door you open, which path you  take around city/your surroundings, items found, information you collect could depend on ""friends"" (and there are not many...) you make, there is so much more that could have been done to make game interesting.,,It is visually beautiful, story is good, but that is where it ends.

When playing, i kept hoping for a game sort of like uncharted, as it was made by the same company, but all I got in my experience was sneaking around, picking up ladders, placing those ladders dow, and climbing up them.  The Last of Us felt more like a movie, you couldn't go more than 5-10 minutes before walking into a cutscene, and even between those cutscenes had no action, the only action going on took place in the cutscenes.  Getting into a cutscene was like rolling the dice, no action in the cutscene, no action in the game, action in the cutscene, well you've got a 50% chance of actually having a thrill in the game.  A little tip to those people who want this game, I'd recommend you just buy a movie instead, you save yourself the money.

CosmotheSloth,"With all the hype surrounding this game, and the talk of a film being made, I was worried then when I finally got to play 'The Last Of Us' it would be another AAA flop. How wrong I was.,,The gameplay itself is a standard 3rd person shooter mechanic, however, in this game there is a large emphasis on stealth and, like a true survival horror style game should do, you feel the need (on many occasion) to avoid contact with the enemy to save your valuable supplies for another, possible harder, encounter. This level of tension and immersion is one that I have never truly experienced with any other game (possibly my attachment to my squad in the final mission of Mass Effect 2) and it's this that takes TLoU to another level of gaming.,,The script and voice acting is sublime which aids with the immersion even further. The atmosphere (music, sound effects, lighting, etc.) of this world created by Naughty Dog is set wonderfully and the gameplay is fluid, effective and exciting. The gameplay is one I would describe as easy to learn - hard to master, which is the kind of gameplay that is few and far between nowadays. The game overall, can be quite difficult, especially for someone of a short attention span who would rather run and gun, but if played correctly, is incredibly rewarding and intense.,,The characters are not only likable but lovable and really make you feel as if you're part of the game. There were parts of the game when I would be shouting at the TV for Ellie or Joel's sake.,,Although having a PS3 when TLoU was release originally, I decided to wait for the game to be rereleased on PS4. Whilst this was probably a good choice with regards to the visuals, I noticed a few glitches that I assumed wouldn't have been present in the original version such as enemies running in circles, falling through the map, and dying instantly when getting stuck on a ledge. However, none of these ruined my experience of the game.,,In addition, DLC and multiplayer actually add to the game for once. The multiplayer is good fun and well built and balanced which is something I wasn't expecting. The DLC builds up the back story and fills in the gaps as brilliantly as the game told the original story.,,All-in-all, TLoU is an experience. An experience that you should not deprive yourself of having. I gave this game a 10/10, not because the game is flawless, but because I haven't enjoyed a game this much for a very long time (and I don't see me doing so for a long time in the future), and in an industry that is awash with repetitive, recycled, bland AAA titles, The Last of Us is a nice reminder that games have the potential to be as brilliant as any other art form.",normal,ps4,2014-09-12,English,4,1,10,train

dangerfar,"Though it seems fairly inconsequential to offer up another option about a game which has had so much written about it in the last year, my perspective is perhaps a bit different than the status quo and thus will offer it. Many reviewers have called this game a masterpiece, of which the 'remastering' simply further elevates its masterpieceness.,,There are 2 areas which I agree The Last of Us is truly extraordinary: characterization and graphical flexibility. Note I didn't say story and graphics, because these paint a large swath over many attributes in which The Last of Us is merely good or perhaps even average.,,There may never have been characters like Joel and Ellie in a video game. If there have been I don't believe I've played it. The facial expressions, motivations, voice acting, and dialogue between them is that of a good movie or TV show. Not a great movie or TV show, but a good one, and that is enough to set it in a league of its own in the video game realm. They are the anchors of the game and without them this game is lost. Everything is built upon their relationship to each other and to the world, and it is executed beautifully.,,Perhaps you were wondering about that second extraordinary characteristic, ""graphical flexibility"" (I'll admit I perhaps just made that up). What I mean by that are moments of truly great presentation that by all accounts would have appeared to be a pre-rendered scene if it weren't for the fact that you just caused it to happen. For instance, say you're in the midst of a zombie horde and out of bullets and decide it's time to give them a good thrashing with your trusty baseball bat. You start to hit them and the camera reacts and Joel's movements look so natural it truly does look right out of a movie. Or if a ""clicker"" gets the better of you and bears into your neck another cut-scene arises that purely originated from your actions. I marveled at these over and over at these thinking something would be messed up, something would be out of place or someone's motions would appear out of place. That never happened. Every time it felt completely real. They've tapped something here that if it could be expanded upon and continued will add a tremendous amount to absorption in a game.,,Now for the rest of it. Well the rest of it is good, if not forgettable. The graphics are solid for sure, good lighting and textures, nothing that hasn't been done before but certainly they are pretty. The story aside from the characters isn't terribly original. There's some interesting twists, but overall there's not much here to separate from the other thousand zombie stories floating around. The gameplay is a bit dull. If you've played any of the Uncharted series you'll likely know their shooting mechanics aren't exactly top shelf, and the solitary puzzle element of finding a ladder or something to jump on isn't terribly riveting. The best moments of combat come from when you run out of bullets and are down on your luck, and have to sneak white knuckled around tons of people who want to kill you.,,Speaking of that, I'll go off on a bit of a tangent and say I'm disappointed (and truthfully not for the first time) that a game that really tries to be realistic and suck you in has tons of people just walking around doing nothing but apparently looking for you without any good reason. The zombies make sense I guess, I wouldn't think they would have daily objectives, but truth be told most of your enemies in this game are comprised of humans who just patrol around dumbly with apparently no purpose in life but to kill people who happen to wander around them. They might as well be zombies themselves. I would have loved to catch some people actually doing something, some tense interactions where you had a bit of a stand off or something. Or at least give me a better reason for them wanting to kill me with such zealotry.,,Anyway, the gameplay isn't very exciting. In fact, I found it so dull I simply stopped playing the game for a long period of time. Eventually I came back and was drawn in enough to finish it, but it sure wasn't the thrill of the hunt. It was Joel and Ellie. They're the heart of the game, and they're a glorious heart indeed. Them with what appeared to me to be a technical breakthrough with aspects of graphics was enough to keep me going.

CreamyyStreams,"It's the same game, it just runs better. And that's fine.,,The Last of Us is known as one of the landmark games of last generation, and it many ways it deserves that honour. It's a game that takes 'cinematic experience' to an entirely new level. However, I'm not among those who happily laud it as the saviour of console gaming.,,As a game that prides itself on its story, it's remarkably bland and predictable. 'Zombie apocalypse' is hardly a unique or innovative setting, and surviving a journey through one isn't much better. There is no 'twist', there is no big reveal and there is no great finale. What The Last of Us does well is delivery. Naughty Dog have provided a strong cast of core and supporting characters that you will genuinely feel attachment to. This is also one of the few games in recent history - especially within the third person shooter genre - that has done character development properly. You will notice a marked difference in the characters' relationships and attitudes as the game progresses. Characters are, for the most part, likeable - even the ones who are intentionally unhelpful.,,However, it's a videogame. It's not unreasonable to expect entertaining and immersive gameplay on top of your narrative progression. For the most part, The Last of Us succeeds in this regard too - with a few rather obnoxious exceptions. Enemies, for example, are entirely oblivious to your AI allies, who in turn behave erratically, have difficulty with pathfinding and have unusual criteria for entering and exiting combat. Attempting and failing a silent takedown, for example, will prompt anyone travelling with you to open fire with the loudest and most obnoxious weapon they happen to have on their person. 'Immersion breaking' doesn't come close to covering it. On the whole, though, combat is satisfying, and although there seems to be an element of luck involved in progressing via stealth it's not entirely unpredictable and feels reasonably rewarding. Gunplay is acceptable and melee weapons feel like they have real weight to them.,,Ultimately, The Last of Us is an uninspired but exceptionally well polished third person shooter with a wonderfully executed narrative built around it. It's by no means the movie game critics make it out to be; it relies more on the player's relationship with the characters and environments than on its relatively weak story, and will hold your attention until the credits roll. Remastered is both visually impressive and deals with the framerate issues that made the original release a chore to play through, and it well worth a purchase to anyone looking to examine the capabilities of the PS4.",normal,ps4,2014-09-10,English,3,0,8,train

CamLuke,With a game like The Last Of Us it is extremely hard to sum up in a short review.  One word that can describe it would be Masterful.  Its game play engine being similar to that of Uncharted and Tomb Raider you can tell that this game is an instant win.  The story delivers to you one that goes in depth like The Walking Dead: Season One but is action packed instead of a point and click.  You get a feeling as if the characters are living people and you feel emotion for them. When I completed the game I felt as if i were saying goodbye to two best friends.  Ellie and Joel.  If there is any game worth a score of 10/10 its this one.,normal,ps4,2014-09-08,English,2,0,10,train

Deusex,"Finally got the chance to play this game. And it is what of thought it be. Is it a bad game? No. But is it great? Not close. It's a good game that's for sure.,Pros:,Atmosphere- it feels all too real. The survival feeling is true. Scavenging ammo during shoot outs whilst taking cover is intense.,Side characters- The situation is tense, you don't know who to trust, or what exactly they might do. But some.. Are just flat out insane.,Ellie- she's a great character, certainly better then Joel. You can relate to her, and always hope the best for her.,,Cons:,Joel- he's a boring character, never had a connection with him, although usually his arsenal is better then Ellie's .,Story- is too far predictable, me and my cousin laughed at times, because we knew what was going to happen. And the ending is sequel heavy. Not satisfying.,Enemies- some will magically see you or notice you even if you were in cover or moving quietly. Some wear helmets, many times I clearly shot the face, and the helmet just falls off. And there is far too many QTE, which makes it a button mashing fest.,Too linear- not enough room to scavenge or plan, it makes the game far too hard. Okay I understand Ellie can't swim, and this adds puzzles for Joel to help Ellie across the water. But why is the a 'convenient' plank for Ellie to step on, every where? It gets old really fast. And the DLC pack that comes with it, makes Ellie do certain actions for no apparent reason. Only to raise more controversy on the game.,,Special mention- this game was fun, but has bad pacing, and a list of other problems from keeping it great for me, but you do get your money's worth, for the length of about 20hrs doing everything. I don't exactly recommend this game, it isn't something special. And on the PS4 the graphics aren't as good as Infamous, it's still PS3 ish.

Misfits95,"This game came off as pretty average to me. People may have certain taste when it comes to what they love of this particular art form. Gameplay for me is crucial to what makes a video game. It's the foundation for many and it's what we would define a video game.,,The Last Of Us excels greatly in its presentation. Graphically it's the best of the best and second to none on console. I actually felt that what I saw in the game was actual real such as the buildings, infected, and people. The environments swell to the brim with technical and graphical brilliance. The characters come off as very interesting with Joel beaten by his 20 year experience in the new world order or his partner, Tess, hopelessly clinging to a hope that is far beyond her reach.,,The plot though unoriginal is performed very well by the games many interesting characters and has the highest of presentation value. The main issue I encountered while playing is that over the course of the main plot the protagonist comes across an epiphany. This is why the game is set in this period because it's the most important part of the protagonist life in this set time period. However, it fell flat when Joel doesn't come across any realization at all and stays the same as he was at the start of the game. Now some would say that Joel realized love, but that's only part of his character. Selfishness is the primary trait that governed Joel from the start of the game to its very end and it was very unsatisfying.,,The gameplay in this game could best be described as repetitive and bare bones. The games constant use of sneak through this environment and kill the same enemies over and over got very boring and it's mechanic of placing boards across gaps was rather laughable. The crafting system is very limiting of what you can make and felt like more of a minor mechanic rather than an essential part of the game. This game also suffers from replayability issues as it's story is rather limiting in interesting and original gameplay. I felt that I was watching a movie rather than playing an interactive piece of media most of the time.,,The multiplayer is this game's saving grace when it comes to gamplay offering very interesting modes that could carry the game on for several years.",normal,ps4,2014-08-31,English,10,3,6,train

flax0174,"As many of you know this a naught dog production, the same developers which produced the stellar uncharted series. It is set in a future post-apolyptic desolate setting of america and is based round a few key and vital characters. The story is about survival and gathering resources for your character to use in crafting aid items, weapon upgrades etc. The game is linear in nature however not that it detracts from its special cinematic sequences or it's beautiful yet eerie setting, plus there is subtle player choice to be had in naughty dog's latest outing say upgrading your weapons, crafting molotovs and first aid items like in rage the video game, very similar. The main aspects of the last of us is its realistic and wonderful graphics, stellar voice acting/animation and the feeling that grips you tight of how close you get to the two main characters in the game. There is certainly a emotional link to them throughout your adventure, and in time it will only grow. the combat system in the game is for the most part very smooth and fluid-like, you can sprint, jog, vault, take cover, sneak etc which all helps to take out your enemies in a stealthy manner or in a brutal, satisfying way. The game does from a story point of view pulls you right in and doesn't let go. It is a mix of survival horror/action adventure with both elements ever so subtle and seamless in their exchange. The aiming in the game is quite bothersome and has a lot of natural sway on the reticle, which can be reduced slightly by finding supplements and herbs to upgrade it with. The level design in the game is top notch, It is very diverse and with that allows you utter freedom to play the game how you want. The story line is very simple but expertly well done. And the ending in my opinion is truly satisfying and well scripted. The attention to detail with the graphics is outstanding, everything is so ironically full of life and colour, the water effects excel with everything i have ever seen. I do however have some minor gripes, but due to being so minor that they do not affect my final score, but there are infrequent graphical bugs, with items disappearing and entire parts of the game as well, but there are seldom seen and only last barely a second. And you can only alter the sensitivity of both analog sticks rather than individually change them. Also the cover mechanic is automated and sometimes you simply cannot stick to a certain wall and on occasion has given my position away. And i do also wish the survival skill system was more abundant in which you had more choice on given gameplay aspects like vaulting and running speed, melee moves, etc. The enemies are fantastic within the game and choose random paths, are quite perceptive and just generally fun to take out. The game has a multiplayer mode which has several modes and about 11 maps, the survival skills, crafting system, weapons, and gameplay mechanics are borrowed from the campaign, which is a good thing. It always for a slow paced and tense experience, certain mechanics are tweaked to allow for a more smoother and balanced play. And is generally a lot of fun, and the one of few multiplayers in which i have enjoyed and dedicated a lot of my time to. But with all the praise, the main reason i love this game is the colourful cast of characters and the emotionally driven storyline.

There are quite a few more.  Their main issue with The Last of Us Remastered is the same frustratingly off-base claim that there isn't enough to warrant a SECOND purchase.  You don't review a remaster for the people who have already played the first one.  You review it on it's own merits, and on it's own merits The Last of Us Remastered cannot possibly receive a LOWER score than the original.  I'm sure there are a ton of PS4 owners who didn't buy the original because they didn't own a PS3.  There are likely many PS4 owners who came from owning the Xbox 360.  Or were only PC gamers.  Or sold their PS3 to pre-order the PS4.  Or any number of possibilities.  You review the game on it's merits.  Not because you, personally, played through the original and want to write a review for only those people who owned the original.

I must admit that when I started playing I thought 'I don't see what all the fuss is about, it's just another FPS'.  But, I was oh so very very wrong. Once the game got going and the story kicked in I was completely hooked and I just needed to know what was going to happen next.  There are certain parts of the game that leave you feeling genuinely upset, others leave you terrified and others make you feel a rush of happiness that you will never have felt in a game before.

The inclusion of the DLC Left Behind is brilliant as well and really add to the story.,,My only gripe would be the inclusion of the Photo Mode being applied to L3.  I ended up switching photo mode off because I was fed up with being in a close quarters fight and the action stopping in Photo Mode as I'd pressed L3 by mistake.

The characters and their interactions are believable and well-written, the gameplay is fluid and allows for multiple approaches to a situation and the graphics, art and music all have high production values and look/sound great. To me it wasn't so much a game as an experience that used cinematic storytelling. The criticism some level at this game, claiming it has 'no gameplay' and is basically one giant cutscene, is incredibly hyperbolic and makes me suspect they either haven't played the game or are just hating on it for no reason. The game doesn't have that many cutscenes at all and they are usually not more than 1 or 2 minutes. I was never annoyed or felt like the pacing of the game suffered from any cutscenes. It used them a lot more sparingly than some other games I've played on PS4, such a tomb raider and infamous second son.,,In conclusion: 10/10, must-get for PS4 if you haven't played it before.",normal,ps4,2014-08-20,English,5,3,10,train

Scavenging is also surprisingly fun, looking for certain items to build explosives, or finding ammo for your gun.,Its unfortunate to see games starting to become more online focused then on the campaign, the Last of us manages to have a fantastic storyline whilst having an enjoyable online experience. The game reminds us how important a campaign is, and how enjoyable and interesting it can be. The Last of Us is a must play for any gamer and a must have on PS4.

Controls were smooth and graphics were good. I guess the main thing I really didn't care for in the game was the fact that you are constantly having to find ammo/survivor gear. I understand it's a survival game but seriously, it's a little ridiculous how much time you actually have to spend finding stuff. Even when I upgraded my weapons and used my ammo only when i needed I still ran out.  The graphics were great and the music was good as well.

The real game though is a serious letdown from what was promised. In the presentation, the A.I. was 100 times smarter than it is now. They said and showed that the A.I. would act different in different situations. For exemple, if an enemy was the last one in the building, they would run for their lives until they are save behind cover, throw something at you to weaken you and then attack you. In the game, they just run at you like some raging headless chicken. Also, when you're holding a gun, and the enemy has a melee weapon, they would sit behind a cornor waiting for you, so they can ambush you. What really happens is, again, they are just raging headless chickens coming at you with their weapon.,,After 5 hours I got SO tired of the 'Hey, let me boost you up' or 'Help me open this door' or 'Help me push this in front of the door' bs.

Nothing else, just that.,,Returning to the story, this is a story made for a movie, not a video game. I don't want to watch a total of 3 hours+ cutscenes, or just walking around with Ellie for 10 minutes, solve a 'puzzle' (getting her on a piece of wood), fight some dudes/infected, cutscene, puzzle, dudes/infected, repeat, repeat, repeat.

With each conversational aside and cutscene I felt myself falling in love with these two protagonists and many of the side characters they encountered.

I often caught myself mesmerized during cutscenes or in gameplay by the masterful environment design, character models and lighting. The power of the PS4 brings to life the texture of this gritty world. Every shattered tile, every fractured street, every scruff of beard and every blade of grass is a thing of beauty in and of itself, especially on closer inspection.,,The mechanics of TLOU are not revolutionary but they are very strong. I found it innovative and appropriate that when crafting or healing you're left totally exposed. It adds an extra level of realism and danger.  TLOU has a few bugs (texture popping, the AI gets stuck occasionally, etc) but nothing that detracts from what is honestly one of the greatest games I've ever played.,,I've only played a little of the multiplayer.

Funkymonk,"Firstly, for the benefit of those of those who havn't heard of this game (!!!) - The Last of Us is a story driven action game with elements of stealth, horror and third person shooting. It was originally released on the PS3 to widespread critical and commercial acclaim with many people considering it one of, if not the best game of the last generation.,Basically, the game is still brilliant and remains the measuring stick for it's genre of game. If you havn't played it before and you've got a PS4 then it's a no brainer, you simply MUST play it. The big question is whether you should buy it if you already own it on PS3. What you're getting apart from the obvious improved graphics is all the DLC and a making of documentary.

parkerbigs84,"Well this is the Remastered; which basically means prettier, version of 'The Last of Us'. Which is absolutely 1 of the best games ever created; if not the single best ever. I absolutely loved everything about 'The Last of Us' when I played through it on the PS3; and there's no exceptions on the PS4. Everything in this game works and fits perfectly together. From the fun; addictive, & unforgettably brutal  gameplay & mechanics to the absolutely Incredible tear jerking, thought provoking, and unforgiving story told through your journey as Joel & Ellie. But even with some of the absolute best story telling & gameplay under its belt you could say that the most impressive part of The Last of Us is the unforgettable acting & voice work. The one & only Troy Baker who plays & voices Joel brings to life one of the all time best & mentally broken characters in any video game, movie or any other form of entertainment. And with that said his partner, Ellie through mostly the entire game is just as equally brilliant & satisfying; and was played & voiced by Ashley Johnson. And that's just those 2 characters. There are SO many absolutely brilliantly written; acted & voiced characters that you not only come into contact with but play their own huge roll in the game, and I of course have to mention that the great & veteran Nolan North too voices & acts out 1 of the games most important characters. 'The Last of Us' will simply have you hooked with your jaw dropping to the ground throughout the entirety of the experience. If you miss out on The last of Us then you are missing out on 1 of the absolute best ""Experiences"" in any form of entertainment.

These elements are polished of the highest order and there aren't many games with this level of presentation and execution. TLOU discredits itself slightly with poor AI and stealth mechanics which can affect the cleanliness of the core gameplay but overall, this is just a minor gripe in what is one of the best games of the last decade. 60fps and the enhanced visuals improve the experience over what was already a stunningly impressive game and it runs perfectly throughout.,,If you've owned TLOU previous; there probably isn't enough here to warrant another play-through unless you are dedicated to the multiplayer aspect or just want to own a piece of history all on one disk including the DLC and other extras.

I am a PS4 convert so I can't comment on the prior console version vs. this one, but as a new player experiencing it, this is as good as it gets for post apocalyptic games that use a zombie-esque  theme.  Voice acting is tremendous, the story is captivating and multi-player is fun and well designed.  All in all a must play game in my book.,,TL;DNR: 10 - superb, smooth graphics, great game play, exciting and challenging combat; tremendous atmosphere and immersion; well written dialogue and excellent story telling all around.  One of the best games ever created.  However, if you have the PS3 version I am not able to comment on any level of improvement, but this current version, for someone new to the PS4 I can say that this is a must play game.,,Technology/engine:  Super smooth graphics, excellent game play supported by flawless optimization.  Use the dual shock very well and nothing feels forced or superfluous.,,AI: Great AI with significant behavior variations keeping the game tense and fluid.,,Graphics: 10 - Absolutely stunning at 60 FPS and 1080p.,,Sound: Excellent ambient noise and great source to distance recognition.  Sound plays a HUGE role in the game and it is very well implemented.,,Soundtrack: 10 - Very fitting music that adds to the intensity and immersion of the game.,,Voice acting: 10 - Excellent acting all around.  Very well delivered dialogue and great moments of small levity in this harsh and cruel future.,,Crafting: 10 - Very well implemented with just the right amount of scarcity of resources.  Crafting can turn the tide of a confrontation, which is how it should.,,Customization: 10 - there is no real variation in appearance but the skill system allows you to augment how you enjoy playing.

MONG,"The Original Was Amazing – This One is Even Better,,The Last of Us became a generation defining title when it launched last year on PlayStation 3, and many would go even further to say that it was instantly one of the best games of all time.  Statements like that are hard to argue against when The Last of Us is now the most awarded game in history by critics.  I fall right into that camp: before playing The Last of Us for the first time, I had never considered a game to be worthy of a 10/10 score.  As immersive as a game may be, as beautiful as it may look, or as gripping as the story may be, I’ve always believed that there will be enough problems to keep games off of the perfect score pedestal.  The Last of Us shattered that belief.,,The Last of Us: Remastered is the exact same game the original was a year ago.  However, it also includes all of the DLC, was upgraded to run at 1080p and 60fps, and includes a photo mode that lets players act like they are using Instagram in the game’s post pandemic setting.,,What all of this meant for me is quite simple — The Last of Us: Remastered instantly overtook the throne of best game I have ever played.  Sure, I will never get the first playthrough reaction again because I know what is going to happen, but does that take away from just how incredible this game is?  Absolutely not.  Recently, one of the writers here at Middle Of Nowhere Gaming made a bold claim that The Last of Us actually gets better the more you play it, unlike most other games.  And you know what? He is completely right; it really does.,,Just how much better could a remastered version be?  Well, let’s talk about just how beautiful TLOU: Remastered really is.  If you played the original on PlayStation 3, you will immediately be able to tell the difference just by watching the opening cutscenes.  Joel and Sarah look much sharper than they used to, and the camera moves around like it’s a feather floating on the wind.  Do you think I am sugarcoating or exaggerating?  I’m not.,,However, even though Remastered looks and feels exponentially better than its source material, there are minor hiccups here and there.  One problem I ran into was that I felt motion sick each time I had to sprint during the first hour or two of the game.  I am by no means a tech-genius, so I can’t say I understand exactly what affects the change from 30fps to 60fps can have on people, but it made me feel sick several times.  But it’s not all bad!  If you decide to stick it out with 60fps instead of locking it back at 30 you will almost certainly grow accustomed to it with time.  It took me about two or three hours to finally shake the feeling.  On top of that, 60fps makes the gunplay so much better.  The combat felt faster and tighter — something that Naughty Dog’s gunfights are not usually known for.,,The only other issue I had with the graphics was the occasional glitch where people would run through walls, get stuck running in place, etc.  This kind of thing happens in just about every game if you look hard enough, so it should be taken lightly because it didn’t happen often.,,Naughty Dog’s decision to add a photo mode to TLOU: Remastered was a very smart move.  What better way to show off all the hard work and dedication the team put into this game than adding the ability to snap awesome photos of the many incredible sights/scenes found in the game?  On top of this, they added the option to add filters to each photo you take, making it feel just like Instagram.  We live in a society where the masses are hungry to share, like, and comment on as much content as possible; Naughty Dog knew this, and it’s why it was such an important addition.,,All of that said, the best part about Remastered may be that it includes the Left Behind DLC and two multiplayer map packs for less than the original price when when the game was released WITHOUT the extra content last year.  Left Behind is a heartwrenching flashback story about Ellie that players will now be able to play whenever they want (preferably after beating the main story). The multiplayer maps were really fun to play on, especially since it runs much smoother graphically now than it used to.,,The Verdict: 10 out of 10,,The Last of Us: Remastered is by far the best game I have played on PlayStation 4 so far, and I now consider it the best game I have ever played.  If you still only have a PlayStation 3, the original version will suite you just fine, as it still holds up incredibly well.  However, if you own a PlayStation 4, you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing the Remastered version.  The graphics are so noticeably better that you will see the difference right away, and the additions of the photo mode and all of the DLC make the package seem criminally underpriced.  Do yourself a favor and get this game.  You’d be hard pressed to find a prettier game that also has one of the best stories ever told in any format.",normal,ps4,2014-08-01,English,30,23,10,train

I give the PS3 version a 10/10, All the DLCs are put together which is fantastic. However, considering the game has just released last year and it already looked very stunning and beautiful, even though this one looks even better with the improvement of graphics and gameplay, it is not significant enough. That doesn't really impress me. I also understand Sony want to give a chance to the Xbox 360 players who switch to PlayStation to play this masterpiece . I appreciate it but barely any other content is added besides that Infamous SS camera. Some glitches and bugs still exist in the remastered version, and the AI don't really have much improvement.

This game won't wow you at first, but the story takes you in and the gameplay gets awesome when you use what you have(molotov,explosives,shotguns,etc).

The art direction is phenomenal, the views are stunning, the characters look great... This is indeed a beautiful looking game.,Furthermore, its performance is a real plus. The PS3 version suffers from framerate dips down to the 20s. The lowest I've experienced on this game must've been around 45-50 fps, during really intense moments (bloaters, for example. Loads of particle effects involved.).,But for the most part, about 98% of the time, it runs at a solid 60fps.,,The gameplay is great, the fist fights are really intense, and the shooting, usually pretty rare, and always short, is really well done.,,But if there is a main reason to play this game, it's its story. It's absolutely phenomenal. The characters are formidable (just try to hate them... oh wait, you can't), the pacing is great and fits the game's atmosphere perfectly, there are some really intense moments... This is a truely great game. One that will be remembered for all the good reasons.,,Of course some people hate on it. But well, it seems to be a trend with PS exclusives...,,Anyways, a serious 10/10.

heckler,"One of the best games I have ever played in my 17 years of playing video games. It isn't perfect, but it is as close to perfection as you could reasonable hope for. What is so special about this game is that while it does the storytelling part of it (story, characters, pacing, ambiance, music) so incredibly well, it doesn't do it to the detriment of its game play. What I actually played perfectly complimented the story they were trying to tell, but when you took those same mechanics, and put them into a competitive multiplayer in the form of Factions, you got one of the most unique (as unique as a TPS multiplayer can be) multiplayers of the last generation. Kudos to Naughty Dog, you guys have achieved something special here. It's too bad some people (looking at the low-effort negatives) can't grant you that much.,,As for the remastered part of this: it is the same video game, but it looks tons better, and it sweetens it by including in game commentary, a photo mode, and all DLC.

Kenmei,"I don't feel the need to rehash everything that has already been said about this game. It was easily in the top 3, probably the best game, for the last gen consoles and it is easily one of the best experiences I've ever had in gaming. But what about the remastered version. Is it worth buying again for those who've already done everything there is to do on the PS3 version? I'd say yes with a few caveats.,The biggest thing you'll notice first is the graphics. There is a very clear upgrade in the visuals, even if it doesn't exactly stand up to a game like inFamous. It comes close but you can tell this was a game that was designed for the last gen consoles. I've heard that it looks like a game that's on Ultra high settings on the PC and I think that's a very good description of it. Plus they've tweaked the controls a bit to help with some of the clunkyness of the original game. I really like the big button in the middle of the controller that opens your inventory screen and it's easier to use than the select button on the old game.,There are a few things that I don't like about this version though and it starts with the price. 50 bucks for this game is way too high. 40 seems reasonable but 50 is really high for a game that's been out for awhile and has been down to 20 bucks in the last week on the old consoles. Plus there have been a number of glitches that occurred in my game. Lots of stiff movements, running through walls, cutscenes not properly loading. It's only happened in the first hour of my playthrough so far but there's been enough of it to cause me an issue. Fortunately nothing has happened during a fight yet so things are not as bad.,The fact of the matter is though that this game is still easily one of the best gaming experiences ever to be released and you're doing yourself an injustice not playing it at least once. For people like myself who have already beaten the main game and DLC on the PS3, there is still alot of playability here mostly for the fact that there's nothing else to really get for the system for awhile. If you're looking for something you know will be excellent and to relive one of the best games in recent memory, then you have to pick this game up.

Fancypenguin,"What can be said about The Last Of Us that can't be said about the The Last Of Us in 60FPS/1080p? Marvel as a few tiny details that you wouldn't notice at all unless somebody told you it was upgraded.  Relive the Masterpiece that won more Game Of The Year Awards than Super Mario Galaxy and Ocarina Of Time combined by having none of that silly gameplay or imagination and more story about dirty depressed people getting their lives F***ed up.  Speaking of Ocarina of Time, if you thought the Water temple from Ocarina Of Time was a mindf**k, prepare for the mind bending puzzles in The Last Of Us, such as moving that same ladder to the same spot in the same way over and over again.  Good game design? Who needs it when you can get perfect 10s by having a story that is the video game equivalent of Oscarbait?  Gaze in absolute awe as you watch the same stealth takedown  a million times, because with the oil tanker full of money that Sony gave Naughty Dog to make this game, they couldn't spring for more than one stealth kill animation.  They say that games are getting dumbed down for the casual gamers nowadays, but I strongly disagree.  At one point in this game, I only had like 30 bullets.  If that's not what you call hardcore survival gaming, then I don't know what is.  People also say that its just ""Another zombie game"" which is ridiculous because they're not zombies.  Its clearly explained that they are a fungal spore, and the fact that they all act exactly like zombies is not important.  Why have interesting level design when you can shepherd the player along linear corridors because you wouldn't want them to get lost on their way to the next cut scene, and have all the fights take place in arenas made of conveniently placed boxes and shipping containers like the new Metal Gear Solid game if Hideo Kojima was on Ambien for the entire development process.  Clunky shooting gameplay? In a zombie game? Who cares, it adds tension, I mean Resident Evil does it, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying The Last Of Us is comparable to Resident Evil, The Last Of US has nowhere near achieved the legacy of Resident Evil, mostly because it hasn't spawned sequel after quality degrading sequel... Yet anyway... Your companion AI often breaks immersion by running around mindlessly without alerting the enemies, but again who cares because story.  To once more bring up Resident Evil, I wish they had made Ellie able to be seen, but you have the option to shove the little brat in a trash bin until the adult stuff is taken care of.  Again, people like to complain that Cinematic games like The Last Of Us are for casuals and are a cancer to the gaming industry, but I like to say they are made for people who want different experiences from games, like somebody who watches movies for the set design.  Cinematic experiences are amazing in games,   why use the power in that Next Gen console to make games with huge open worlds or give the game more dynamic AI when you can use it to replicate movies?  Furthermore, why let a game's gameplay influence your experience with and feelings toward it,?  I definitely won't  miss moments like in Twilight Princess when I first stood on the cliff overlooking Lake Hylia, the guitar track playing a solemn melody, as I stared at a dark but beautiful world, ravaged by an ongoing struggle for the Triforce, I, the lone hero sent to save it.  Screw that, I'd much rather the game yell ""THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD BE FEELING AND WHAT YOU SHOULD BE EXPERIENCING"" at me with the subtlety of Nic Cage in a French art film.  Its not like video games are the one artistic medium that allow you to interact and effect the outcome of the actions being portrayed on screen (Well besides maybe a choose your own adventure novel). One probably wonders why every game doesn't take as much control as possible out of the players hand so they can watch all the interesting stuff happen in a cutscene they can't interact with in anyway.  Overall, The Last Of Us is a great story, with a so-so game buried deep within it.  That equates to a Great game overall that is better than the sum of its parts and not a masterpiece like everybody says it is. But my opinion is moot anyway, seeing as everybody else is just going to give it a 10 so why did I even bother?",normal,ps4,2014-07-29,English,12,7,8,train
